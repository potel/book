\section{Simultaneous versus successive Cooper pair transfer in nuclei}\label{C2S1}
Cooper pair transfer is commonly thought to be tantamount to simultaneous transfer. In this process a nucleon goes over through the $NN$-interaction $v$, the second one does it making use of the correlations with its partner (cf. Figs. \ref{fig_alpha} and \ref{figC7C1} (I)). Consequently, in the independent particle limit, simultaneous  transfer should not be possible (see Sect. \ref{C7S7C1}). Nonetheless, it remains operative. This is because, in this limit, the particle transferred through $v$ does it together with a second one which profits from the non-orthogonality of the wavefunctions describing the single-particle motion in target and projectile (Figs. \ref{fig_beta} and \ref{figC7C1} (II)). This is the reason why this (non-orthogonality) transfer amplitude has to be treated on equal footing with  the previous one  representing, within the non-orthogonal basis employed, a natural contribution to simultaneous transfer. In fact ($T^{(1)}-T^{(1)}_{NO}$) is the correct,  two-nucleon transfer amplitude to lowest order (first) in $v$. The resulting cancellation is quite conspicuous in actual nuclei  (see Figs. \ref{fig_2A2} (b), \ref{fig_2A3}, and Fig. \ref{fig2A4} for examples in open shell (superfluid) and closed shell (normal) nuclei respectively). This is in keeping with the fact that Cooper pairs are weakly correlated systems ($2\Delta\ll\epsilon_F$), and the reason why the successive transfer process in which $v$ (e.g.  the mean field $U$ in the post-post representation\footnote{\cite{Bayman:82,Potel:13}.  See also \cite{Pinkston:82}.}) acts twice, is the dominant mechanism in pair transfer reactions. While this mechanism seems antithetical to the transfer of  correlated fermions pairs, it probes, in the nuclear case, the same pairing correlations as simultaneous transfer does\footnote{Within this context note however the possible interplay in reactions between heavy ions at energies below the Coulomb barrier, between the distance of closest approach and the correlation length $\xi$ (see Sect. \ref{S7.3} as well as Eqs. (\ref{eq3B8})--(\ref{eq3B10})).}. This is because nuclear Cooper pairs (quasi-bosons) are quite extended objects, the two nucleons being (virtually) correlated over distances $\xi$  \idx{Cooper pair!--mean square radius (correlation length)} larger than typical nuclear dimensions (see Fig. \ref{fig_gamma}). In a two-nucleon transfer process this virtual property becomes real, in the sense that the presence of (normal) density over regions larger than that of the dimensions of each of the interacting nuclei allows for  Cooper pair (abnormal density) manifestation over distances of the order of $\xi$.



Within this context, let us refer to the Josephson effect, associated with the Cooper pair tunneling across a thin barrier separating two metallic superconductors. Because the probability of one-electron-tunneling is small, (conventional) simultaneous tunneling associated with that probability quantity square would hardly be observed. Nonetheless, Josephson currents are standard measures in low temperature laboratories\footnote{cf. e.g. \cite{Rogalla:12} and references therein.}.
The same arguments related  to the large value of the correlation length is operative in explaining the fact that Coulomb repulsion is rather weak between partners of Cooper pairs which are, in average, at a distance $\xi (\approx 10^{4}$ \AA{}) much larger than the Wigner-Seitz radius $r_s$ typical of metallic elements ($\approx 1-2$ \AA{}). Consequently, it can be overcompensated and turned into an effective (weakly) attractive force by the long range electron-phonon pairing. 


Similarly, in widely extended light halo nuclei, the short range bare pairing interaction may  become subcritical due to the poor overlap between the halo neutrons and the core ones (cf. Sect. \ref{App1AF}). The fact that such systems are nonetheless bound, although weakly, testifies to the important role the exchange of collective vibrations between halo nucleons have in binding the associated halo Cooper pair.


The above arguments are at the basis of the fact that second order DWBA theory which add both successive \idx{Josephson effect!successive tunneling}
 and non-orthogonality contributions to the simultaneous transfer amplitudes, are needed in a quantitative description of the experimental findings.

Within this context, while $T^{(2)}_{NO}$ receives contributions from the intermediate (virtual) closed ($d+F$) channel as $T^{(2)}_{succ}$ does, it is first order in $v$ as $T^{(1)}$ is.}\label{fig_beta}

\section[Transfer probabilities, enhancement factor]{One- and two-nucleon transfer probabilities}\label{C3S2}
%As discussed in Chapter \ref{intro}, the enhancement factor in a two-nucleon transfer reaction can be defined in terms of two-particle units\footnote{cf. e.g. \cite{Broglia:72b,Broglia:73} and references therein.}, similar to what is done in the case of electromagnetic decay. Let us, for simplicity, write such a relation as
%\begin{align}\label{eq3.2.1}
%\left.\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right)_{2n}=\left|\langle f|P^\dagger|i\rangle \right|^2\left(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right)^{(0)}_{2n},
%\end{align} 
%where $\left(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right)^{(0)}_{2n}$ is the absolute differential cross section associated with a typical pure single--pair configuration $|j^2(0)\rangle$ (or the average value over pairs based on the valence orbitals).  In the case of a superfluid nucleus like e.g. $^{120}$Sn and for $i=$gs(A) and $f=$gs(A+2) as well as $f=2qp$(A+2) one can write 
%\begin{align}\label{eq3.2.2}
%\left|\langle f|P^\dagger|i\rangle \right|^2=\left\{\begin{array}{l}
% \alpha_0^{'2}=\left(\sum_{\nu>0}U'_{\nu}V'_{\nu}\right)^2=\left(\frac{\Delta}{G}\right)^2\approx\frac{A}{4}\approx 30\; (f=gs),\\
% U_\nu^4\approx 1\; (f=2qp),
%\end{array} \right.
%\end{align} 
%where it has been used $\Delta=12\text{ MeV}/A^{1/2}$ and $G=25\text{ MeV}/A$. Thus, the expected \textit{enhancement} factor\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Brink:05} p. 324} is given by the ratio, 
%\begin{align}\label{eq3.2.3}
%R=\frac{\left.\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}(gs\rightarrow gs)\right)_{2n}}{\left.\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}(gs\rightarrow 2qp)\right)_{2n}}\approx 30.
%\end{align}
%In other words, in superfluid nuclei one expects the $0^+$ pairing vibrational states to carry a (summed) cross section of the order of 3\% that of the $gs\rightarrow gs$ transition (cf. Fig. \ref{fig1.4}).
%Now, in defining the quantity $R$, use was made of (\ref{eq3.2.1}). Because both numerator and denominator are linear in $\left(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right)_{2n}^{(0)}$, one could as well posit that one has used (\ref{eq3.2.2}) in defining $R$.
%171

%
%The situation is  quite different when one intends to define the ratio of probabilities associated with one- and two-particle transfer processes. One can, in principle, use again  (\ref{eq3.2.1}) for the case of $2n$-transfer and eventually
%\begin{align}\label{eq3.2.4}
%\left(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right)_{1n}=S\left(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right)_{1n}^{(0)},
%\end{align}
%for the case of $1n$-transfer, $S$ being known in the literature as the spectroscopic factor, and used here for illustration purposes only. However, in trying to define an enhancement factor in terms of $P_{2n}/P_{1n}^2$, the approximate relations (\ref{eq3.2.1}) and (\ref{eq3.2.4}) will now condition the physics one is trying to extract from the experimental (empirical) information. In fact, in this case the actual values of $\left(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right)_{1n}^{(0)}$ and of $\left(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right)_{2n}^{(0)}$ will play an important role, and this can lead to errors. A more proper definition of the transfer probabilities is to be made in terms of the total reaction cross section.

In what follows we define transfer probabilities $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ for one- and two-nucleon transfer. For this purpose let us remind some useful relations. In particular that of the differential reaction cross section 
\begin{align}
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=|f(\theta)|^2,
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
f(\theta)=\frac{1}{k}\sum_l(2l+1)e^{i\delta_l}\sin\delta_lP_l(\cos\theta),
\end{align}
$\delta_l$ being the partial wave $l$ phase shift. Let us now use for simplicity the results associated with hard sphere scattering\footnote{cf. e.g. \cite{Sakurai:94}.} in the low and high energy limit, $R$ being the radius of the sphere. Making use of the fact that in the case under discussion the phase shifts $\delta_l$ are related to the regular and irregular spherical Bessel functions,
\begin{align}\label{eq3.2.8}
\tan\delta_l=\frac{j_l(kR)}{n_l(kR)},
\end{align}
and that $\sin^2\delta_l=\tan^2\delta_l/(1+\tan^2\delta_l)$,  one can write in the case in which $kR\ll1$, i.e. in the low-energy, long wavelength, regime
\begin{align}
\tan\delta_l\approx\frac{-(kR)^{2l+1}}{(2l+1)[(2l-1)!!]^2},
\end{align}
implying that one can ignore essentially all $\delta_l$ with $l\neq0$. Thus, $\tan\delta_0=-k R$, $\sin^2\delta_0=(kR)^2$ and one can write,
\begin{align}
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{\sin^2\delta_0}{k^2}=R^2.
\end{align}
Consequently,
\begin{align}
\sigma_{tot}=\int\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}d\Omega=4\pi R^2\quad(kR\ll1),
\end{align}
a cross section which is four times the geometric cross section $\pi R^2$, namely the area of the disc of radius $R$ that blocks the propagation of the incoming (plane) wave, and has the same value as that of a hard sphere. Because $kR\ll1$  
implies long wavelength scattering, it is not surprising that quantal effects are important, so as to overwhelm the classical picture\footnote{Effects related with Heisenberg's indeterminacy principle. The original German word \textit{Unbestimmtheitsprinzip} (``indefiniteness'' or ``indeterminacy principle'') is sometimes incorrectly translated as ``uncertainty principle'. This is  misleading, since it suggests that the electron or the nucleon actually has a definite position and momentum of which one is uncertain. In fact, the quantum formalism simply does not allow the ascription of a definite position and momentum simultaneously (see \cite{Leggett:87}).}. 


Let us now consider the high energy limit $kR\gg 1$. The total cross section is in this case, given by
\begin{align}\label{eq3.2.6}
\nonumber\sigma_{tot}=&\int |f_l(\theta)|^2d\Omega=\frac{1}{k^2}\int_0^{2\pi}d\phi\int_{-1}^{1}d(\cos\theta)\sum_{l=1}^{kR}\sum_{l'=1}^{kR}(2l+1)(2l'+1)\\
&\times e^{i\delta_l}\sin\delta_l\times  e^{-i\delta_{l'}}\sin\delta_{l'}\times P_lP_{l'}=\frac{4\pi}{k^2}\sum_{l=1}^{kR}(2l+1)\,\sin^2\delta_l.
\end{align}
Making use of the relation
\begin{align}\label{eq3.2.7}
\sin^2\delta_l=\frac{\tan^2\delta_l}{1+\tan^2\delta_l}=\frac{[j_l(kR)]^2}{[j_l(kR)]^2+[n_l(kR)]^2}\approx\sin^2\left(kR-\frac{\pi l}{2}\right),
\end{align}
and the fact that so many $l$-values contribute to (\ref{eq3.2.6}), one can replace $\sin^2\delta_l$ by its average value 1/2. Because the number of terms of the sum is roughly $kR$, the same being true for the average value of $(2l+1)$, one can thus write
\begin{align}\label{eq3.2.13}
\sigma_{tot}=\frac{4\pi}{k^2}(kR)^2\frac{1}{2}=2\pi R^2,\quad (kR\gg1)
\end{align}
which, in this short wavelength limit, is not the geometric cross section either. In fact, (\ref{eq3.2.13}) can be split into two contributions each of value $\pi R^2$. One due to reflection in which it can be shown that there is no interference amongst contributions from different $l$-values. A second one (coherent contribution in the forward direction) called shadow because for hard-sphere scattering at high energies, waves with impact parameter less than $R$ must be deflected. Consequently, behind the scatterer there must be zero probability for finding the scattered particle and a shadow must be generated\footnote{In terms of wave mechanics, this shadow is due to the destructive interference between the original wave (which would be there even if the scatterer was absent), and the newly scattered wave. Thus, one needs scattering in order to create a shadow. This contribution is intimately related to the optical theorem (\cite{Sakurai:94})
\begin{align*}
\sigma_{tot}=\frac{4\pi}{k}\Im[f(\theta=0,k)]=\frac{4\pi}{k}[f_{shad}(\theta=0,k)]=\frac{4\pi}{k^2}\sum_l(2l+1)\sin^2\delta_l,
\end{align*}
to which it provides its physical interpretation. In fact,  there are two independent ways of measuring $\sigma_{tot}$, namely: i) by integrating the differential cross section $d\sigma/d\Omega=|f(\theta)|^2$ moving around the detector, ii) measuring the attenuation of the incoming beam. Both procedures should give the same result. One then identifies $(4\pi/k)f(\theta=0,k)$ with the attenuation arising from the interference of the elastic wave with the incoming wave. Of notice that in (\ref{eq3.2.6}) the factor $(\pi/k^2)(2l+1)=\pi\lambdabar^2(2l+1)$ is the area of a ring  with radius $b=(l+1/2)\lambdabar$ and width $\lambdabar$ due to quantal indeterminacy. Thus
\begin{align*}
\sigma_{tot}=2\pi(R+\lambdabar/2)^2\quad(kR\gg1).
\end{align*}}.
The quantity
\begin{align}\label{eq3.2.16}
\lambdabar=\frac{\lambda}{2\pi}=\frac{h}{2\pi p}=\frac{\hbar}{p}=\frac{1}{k}=\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2mE}},
\end{align}
is the reduced de Broglie wavelength\footnote{\cite{Broglie:25}.} for a massive particle ($E=p^2/2m$). For a proton of energy $E_p\approx 20$ MeV, typical of beams used in $^{120}$Sn$(p,t)^{118}$Sn(gs) and $^{120}$Sn$(p,d)^{119}$Sn($j$) reactions\footnote{Of notice that the reduced wavelength of a photon ($p=E/c$) of the same energy ($E= 20$ MeV) is $\lambdabar (=\lambda/2\pi=\hbar/p=\hbar c/E)\approx 10$ fm (cf. Table 2.1 p. 22 \cite{Satchler:80}).} $\lambdabar\approx 1$ fm, to be compared with the value $R\approx 6$ fm of the radius of $^{120}$Sn. Consequently, we are in a situation of type (\ref{eq3.2.13}), that is,
\begin{align}
\sigma_{tot}=2\pi(6)^2\;\text{fm}^2\approx 2.3\;\text{b}.
\end{align}
Because typical values of the absolute one-particle cross section associated  with the $(p,d)$ reaction mentioned above are few mb (see e.g. Fig. \ref{fig6.2.3} right panel) one can use, for order of magnitude estimate purposes,  
\begin{align}\label{eq4.2.12}
P_1\approx\frac{5.35\; \text{mb}}{2.3\;\text{b}}\approx 10^{-3}, \idx{Two-nucleon transfer!one- and two-particle transfer probabilities}
\end{align}
as  typical probability for such processes. \textit{Consequently, one may argue that the probability for a  pair of nucleons to simultaneously tunnel in e.g. the $(p,t)$ process mentioned above is $(P_1)^2\approx10^{-6}$, as near impossible as no matter}. 


Within this context we note that the integrated gs $\rightarrow$ gs absolute cross section $\sigma(^{120}$Sn$(p,t)^{118}$Sn(gs))$\approx 2.25 \pm$0.338 mb, quantity representative of the population of the members of the  Sn-isotopes ground state rotational band (see Figs. \ref{fig1.3}, \ref{fig1.5} and \ref{fig8_2_4})\footnote{Concerning the marked fluctuations observed in these cross sections see Sect. \ref{S3.1.1}, second paragraph.}. A fact which implies\footnote{See footnote \ref{f28} of Ch. \ref{chapter1} and related text.} that the empirical two-nucleon transfer probability is of the order of $P_2\approx 10^{-3}$, i.e. $P_2\approx P_1$. \idx{Josephson effect!successive tunneling}




It is to be noted that  perplexities similar to the one expressed above,  also emerged in connection with the study  of Cooper pair tunneling between weakly coupled superconductors. In fact, objections were raised\footnote{\cite{Bardeen:62,Bardeen:61} (see also \cite{Pippard:12,Cohen:62,McDonald:01}).}   in connection with the prediction of Josephson\footnote{\cite{Josephson:62}, \cite{Anderson:64b}.} that there should be a contribution to the current through an insulating barrier between two superconductors which would behave like direct tunneling of condensed pairs. This is in keeping with the fact that having the single electron a rather small probability of getting through the insulating junction,  the ``classical'' estimate of simultaneous pair tunneling will not be observable. Let alone the fact that the (local) pairing interaction vanishes inside the barrier\footnote{\cite{Anderson:70};  see also \cite{Broglia:19d} p. xxi-xxiii in connection with the nuclear case.}.


\section{Phase correlation and enhancement factor}\label{S4.3}
When one turns on, in an open shell atomic nucleus like e.g. $^{120}_{50}$Sn$_{70}$, a pairing interaction of strength larger than critical, the system moves into a Cooper pair regime\footnote{Regime which is conditioned by the ``external'' mean field. In other words, regime (abnormal density) which express itself provided there is nucleon (normal) density available. It is of notice that pairing in turn may help extend the range over which normal nuclear density can reach, as in the case of the neutron halo nucleus $^{11}$Li  defining (lying at) the neutron drip line.}. This fact has quantitative (but not qualitative)  consequences concerning the one-particle transfer mechanism,  and regards the size of the mismatch between the relative motion incoming ($p+^{120}$Sn(gs)) and outgoing ($d+^{119}$Sn(gs)) trajectories ($Q$-value and recoil effect). This is in keeping with the fact that one has to break a Cooper pair to populate a single  quasiparticle state. From a structure point of view, the depletion of the occupation probability measured in a $(p,d)$ process is correlated with the corresponding increase in occupation observed in $(d,p)$ ($U^2,V^2$ factors). Aside  from the detailed quantitative values, this is quite similar to what is observed in dressed single-particle states in normal nuclei, the single-particle sum rule involving both the ($A-1$) and ($A+1$) aside from the $A$ systems (see Sect. \ref{C6AppI}). Concerning the phase coherence of the pair correlated wavefunction, it has no consequence for one-particle transfer process, in keeping with the fact that $|e^{i\phi}\sqrt{P_1}|^2=P_1$. A further reminder  that not one, but two-particle transfer is the specific probe of pairing in nuclei.




In fact, qualitative, and not only quantitative differences are found concerning pair transfer  when the Fermi system changes from the normal into the superconducting state. A result of the fact that in this phase transition, more or less the same set of (phase disordered) renormalized many-body states  become superposed with a fixed phase relation (see Eq. (\ref{eq3.4.2})) described by the $\ket{BCS}_{\mathcal K'}=\prod_{\nu>0}\left(U'_\nu+e^{-2i\phi} V'_\nu a_\nu^\dagger a^\dagger_{\tilde\nu}\right)\ket{0}$ state which displays \idx{Off-diagonal-long-range-order (ODLRO)}
 ODLRO\footnote{See footnote \ref{f37c1} Ch. \ref{introduction}.}. As a consequence, in the calculation of the Cooper pair transfer probability, one has to add phased amplitudes before one takes modulus squared \idx{Josephson effect!successive tunneling}
 (\cite{Josephson:62}). That is
\begin{align}\label{eq3.2.19}
\nonumber P_2=&\left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(U_\nu'\sqrt{P_1}+e^{-2i\phi}V'_\nu\sqrt{P_1}\right)\right|^2\\ \idx{Josephson effect!transfer (tunneling) probability}
&=\frac{P_1}{2}  \left(1+2U_\nu'V_\nu'\cos2\phi\right)\approx P_1 \idx{Cooper pair!transfer probability (Josephson effect)} 
\end{align}
In other words, it is like interference in optics, with phase-coherent mixing. We note that above it was assumed $U'_\nu V'_\nu|_{\epsilon_F}\approx1/2$ and $\cos2\phi\approx1$. Within this context see Sect. \ref{S5.5.1}.
 
 In connection with pair transfer experimental probes involving intrinsic (as opposite to relative motion) energy exchange $<2\Delta$ and relative distances of closest approach $D_0\lesssim \xi$,  the partners nucleons of the transferred Cooper pair are correlated over distances of the order of 15--20 fm  (Fig. \ref{fig3.2.1} (b)), the intrinsic motion being frozen because of the pairing gap. A situation quite different from that of a normal system characterized by independent nucleon motion, where the relative distance between nucleons is  $\approx$ 2.4 fm  (Fig. \ref{fig3.2.1} (a)). 
 
 
 To the extent that the mean field acting as an ``external'' field allows particle density to be present, the properties of phase correlated, independent Cooper pair motion will explicit themselves. And thus it is a physical condition which is assumed fulfilled each time one  makes use of the physical picture provided by Fig. \ref{fig3.2.1} (b). In other words, inside $^{120}$Sn all (6--8) Cooper pairs will be found within a volume of radius $R_0\approx 6$ fm, in a similar way in which the transferred Cooper pair can be distributed over two nuclear volumes during the contact time  in e.g. a Sn+Sn heavy ion reaction (Fig. \ref{fig_1}).  A phenomenon to which the long-range induced pairing interaction (exchange of phonons) contributes in the case of  nuclei lying along the stability valley, let alone in the case of light halo nuclei like $^{11}$Li (Fig. \ref{fig3.2.2})\footnote{In this case $R$($^{11}$Li)=4.58$\pm0.13$ fm, the ``effective'' Wigner-Seitz radius being $(r_0)_{eff}\approx 4.58$ fm/$(11)^{1/3}\approx2.1$ fm.}.
 
 
 The interest of the  picture shown in Fig. \ref{fig3.2.1} (b) can also be exemplified by referring to the fact that the moment of inertia of heavy deformed nuclei is considerably smaller than the rigid moment of inertia, but still larger than the irrotational one\footnote{\cite{Bohr:75,Belyaev:59,Belyaev:13}.} ($5\mathcal J_{irrot}\lesssim\mathcal J\lesssim  \mathcal J_r/2$). Even confined within the mean field of the nucleus, \idx{Cooper pair!--confinement (by an external field)}
  the small but finite number   of phase correlated pairs \idx{BCS!--condensation (phase coherence)} having the ``intrinsic'', infinite-matter-like tendency will, to some extent, average out the different orientations of the rotating system and react to it in terms of an effective inertia smaller than the one related to the independent particle motion in a deformed potential (rigid moment of inertia). However, constrained by such a potential, they cannot fully profit of BCS  condensation \idx{Off-diagonal-long-range-order (ODLRO)}
   (ODLRO). To have irrotational flow, one has to have $\Delta\gg \hbar\omega_0$. 	
 \idx{Cooper pair!--confinement (and moments of inertia)}
 	Summing up, $\mathcal J_{irrot}=\delta^2\mathcal J_{rig}\approx\delta^2\times2\mathcal J_{exp}\approx(2/10)\times\mathcal J_{exp}\approx\mathcal J_{exp}/5$, where\footnote{See p. 47, \cite{Bohr:75}.} $\delta\approx0.95\,\beta_2$, typical values of $\beta_2$ being $\approx0.3$.

\caption{(\textbf{a}) Schematic representation of independent-particle motion and (\textbf{b}) independent-pair motion. In the first case nucleons (fermions) move independently of each other, their relative distance being $2r_0(\approx 2.4$ fm).  Switching on the pairing interaction (bare plus induced) leads to Cooper pair formation in which the correlation length (mean square radius) is $\xi$. Pairs of nucleons moving in time reversal states close to the Fermi energy will tend to recede from each other lowering their relative momentum $(r_0\rightarrow \xi)$ thus boosting the stability of the system, provided that the external mean field allows for it. Or better, if  there is (normal) nucleon density available to do so, something controlled to a large extent by the single-particle potential. From this point on, and at least for the levels lying close to the Fermi surface, one cannot talk about particles but about Cooper pairs (unless one does not intervene the system with an external field, e.g. $(p,d)$ and provides the energy, angular and linear momentum needed to break a pair). The picture displayed in (b) is likely to be the one that is operative in the case of e.g. two nuclei of  Sn at a relative (CM) distance somewhat larger than $2R_0$ ($\approx 12$ fm), but still allowing for  (weak) contact. The pair field associated with  Cooper pairs will extend from one to the other partner of the heavy ions participating in the reaction through the weakly overlapping interaction region, allowing two nucleons to correlate over a distance $\xi$ and, eventually, in a reaction like e.g. $^{A+2}$Sn+$^{A'}$Sn$\rightarrow$ $^{A}$Sn(gs)+$^{A'+2}$Sn(gs) allow for the successive transfer of two nucleons correlated over distances larger than nuclear dimensions.}\label{fig3.2.1}

\end{figure}
Within this context we note that the (approximate) form of the (local) pair wavefunction can be written as\footnote{cf. \cite{Leggett:06} p. 185; for the non local nuclear version cf. e.g. \cite{Broglia:83c}.}
\begin{align}\label{eq4.3.2}
F(r)\approx\Delta N(0)\frac{\sin k_F r}{k_Fr}\exp\left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}\,r}{\xi}\right),
\end{align}
where $N(0)$ is the density of levels at the Fermi energy for one spin orientation. For $r\lesssim\xi$ the pair wavefunction is approximately proportional to that of two particles at the Fermi energy moving freely in a relative $s$-wave state. In a typical metallic superconductor $\xi$ is of the order of 1 $\mu$m ($10^4$ \AA), much larger than the inter electron spacing ($\approx 2$ \AA). Note that relative to the Fermi energy, the correlation energy ($E_{corr}=(-1/2)N(0)\Delta^2$) associated with Cooper pairing is very small, $\approx 10^{-7}-10^{-8}$. Arguably, the most important consequence of this fact, is the exponentially large mean square radius and thus very small value of the relative momentum associated with Cooper pairs. In other words, the typical scenario for a very small value of the quantum localization kinetic energy and thus of the generalized quantality parameter \idx{Cooper pair!generalized quantality parameter} (see Sect. \ref{App1D} and App. \ref{App6H}), implying that the two partners of the Cooper pair, are  anchored (entangled) to each other. This phenomenon is at the basis  of the emergence of new elementary modes of excitation. Pairing vibrations for single Cooper pairs, pairing rotations for few ones, supercurrents and Josephson currents for macroscopic amounts of them.



The situation of very extended Cooper pairs sounds, in principle, very different in the case of condensed matter (e.g. low-temperature superconductors) than in atomic nuclei, in keeping with the fact that nuclear Cooper pairs are, as a rule, subject to an overwhelming external (mean) field ($|E_{corr}|\approx 2\Delta\approx2.4$ MeV $\ll |U(r\approx R_0)|\approx |V_0/2|\approx 25 $ MeV), and thus confined within dimensions $R_0\ll\xi$. But even in this case one can posit that  the transition from independent-particle to phase correlated, independent-pair motion, implies that Cooper pair partners show a tendency to recede from each other. Let us clarify this point for the case of a single pair, e.g. $^{210}$Pb(gs). It is true that allowing the pair of neutrons to correlate in the valence orbitals leads to a pair wavefunction which is angle correlated ($\Omega_{12}\approx 0$), as compared to e.g. the pure $j^2(0)(j=g_{9/2})$ configuration\footnote{\label{C4f17}\cite{Bertsch:67}, \cite{Ferreira:84,Matsuo:13} and references therein.} (Sect. \ref{app3D}). On the other hand, the correlated pair addition mode (Tables \ref{tab1E4} and \ref{tab1E5}) will display a sizeable spill out as compared to the pure two particle state, and thus a tendency to lower the relative momentum  between Cooper pair partners. This is also connected with the fact that close to $\approx 40$\% of the pairing matrix elements is contributed by the induced pairing interaction resulting from the exchange of long wavelength, low-lying, collective modes, the other $\approx$ 60\% resulting from the bare nucleon-nucleon $^1S_0$ pairing interaction\footnote{\label{f17C4} In carrying out the above arguments the values of $(|E_{corr}|/\epsilon_F)^2\approx \left(\frac{2.4 \,\text{MeV}}{36\,\text{MeV}}\right)^2\approx 10^{-3}$ and $\xi=\frac{\hbar v_F}{\pi\Delta}\approx 14$ fm ($(\frac{v_F}{c})\approx (k_F)_{\text{fm}^{-1}}/5\approx 0.27$; $\Delta\approx 1.2$ MeV), typical for superfluid nuclei lying along the stability valley, were used.}. 


The situation described above becomes likely clearer, even if extreme, in the case of $^{11}$Li. In this case, the Fermi momentum is $k_F\approx 0.8\, \text{fm}^{-1}$, the radius $R\approx 4.58 $fm being much larger than $R_0=2.7$ fm expected from systematics. Furthermore essentially all of the correlation energy ($E_{corr}\approx -0.5$ MeV)\footnote{\label{f18C4} $(E_{corr}/\epsilon_F)^2\approx (0.5/13)^2\approx 10^{-3}, \xi\approx 20 $ fm ($v_F/c\approx0.2(k_F)_{\text{fm}^{-1}}\approx 0.16$; Eq. (\ref{eqApp6H9}) and footnote \ref{fnC655} of Chapter \ref{C8}.}  is associated with the exchange of the  pygmy dipole resonance between the halo neutrons\footnote{See \cite{Barranco:01}; see also \cite{Broglia:19}.}. It is of notice that in this case, as already stated, renormalization effects due to the clothing of single-particle states by vibrations, are as strong as mean field effects.
\clearpage


 Again in this case $s_{1/2}^2(0)$ and $p_{1/2}^2(0)$ are not correlated in $\Omega_{12}$, while the Cooper state probability density displays a clear angular correlation \idx{Cooper pair!--angular correlation}
  (see Fig. \ref{fig1F3} (II) (a) and (b)). Nonetheless, the average distance between the partners of the neutron halo Cooper pair, is considerably larger than that associated with the $^9$Li core nucleons as a consequence of the induced (soft $E1$-mode exchange) pairing interaction, and as testified by the following numerical estimates (see also Fig. \ref{fig3.2.2}):
\begin{align}\label{eq3.2.21}
 \text{a)}\quad R(^{11}\text{Li})= 4.58\pm 0.13 \,\text{fm}\quad (V=\left(4\pi/3\right)R^3=402.4 \,\text{fm}^3)
\end{align}
\begin{align}
 \text{b)}\quad R_0 (^{11}\text{Li})=2.7\,\text{fm}\quad (V=82.4\,\text{fm}^3)
\end{align}
\begin{align}
 \text{c)}\quad R_0 (^{9}\text{Li})=2.5\,\text{fm}\quad (V=65.4\,\text{fm}^3),
\end{align}
and associated mean distance between nucleons, 
\begin{align}\label{eq3.2.24}
 \text{a)}\quad \left(\frac{337\,\text{fm}^3}{2}\right)^{1/3}\approx 5.5\,\text{fm},\quad((402.4-65.4)\text{ fm}^3)
\end{align}
\begin{align}
 \text{b)}\quad \left(\frac{82.4\,\text{fm}^3}{11}\right)^{1/3}\approx 1.96\,\text{fm},
\end{align}
\begin{align}\label{eq4.3.9}
 \text{c)}\quad \left(\frac{65.4\,\text{fm}^3}{9}\right)^{1/3}\approx 1.94\,\text{fm}.
\end{align}



The above quantities are to be compared with the definition\footnote{\cite{Brink:05} App. C.},
\begin{align}\label{eq3.2.27}
d=\left(\frac{\frac{4\pi}{3}R^3}{A}\right)^{1/3}=\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{1/3}\times r_0\approx 1.93\, \text{fm},
\end{align} 
consistent with the standard parametrization $R_0=r_0A^{1/3}$ of the nuclear radius. It is written in terms of the  radius $r_0$ (=1.2 fm) of the Wigner-Seitz cell associated with each nucleon, and derived from systematics of stable nuclei lying along the stability valley.
\subsection{Interplay between mean field and correlation length}\label{S4.3.1}
In Fig. \ref{fig3.2.1} one displays a schematic representation of the basis for two possible \textit{gedankenexperiment} situations: (\textbf{a}) (\textit{independent particle motion}), system which can be probed in a $(p,t)$ reaction leading insight into  non-interacting pairs of nucleons moving in time reversal states and confined by a mean field potential; (\textbf{b}) (\textit{phase correlated independent pair motion}), system probed in e.g. two-nucleon transfer process induced by  a heavy ion reaction between superfluid nuclei  (see Sect. \ref{S7.3}). In this case it is assumed that pairs of nucleons moving in time reversal states interact through an effective pairing interaction $v_p^{eff}$, sum of a bare $NN$-$^1S_0$ potential ($v_p^{bare}$) and an induced ($v_p^{ind}$) pairing component. As a result they become weakly bound with an energy $2\Delta\,(\ll\epsilon_F)$, condensing  in the BCS state and giving rise to the nuclear abnormal density in which the average distance between the pair partners is considerably larger than the relative distance associated with normal density ($\approx2r_0$). Expressed it differently and in keeping with the parallel  with the BCS description of low temperature superconductivity found at the basis of nuclear BCS\footnote{\cite{Bohr:58}.}, one can assume that pairs of correlated nucleons moving in time reversal states close to the Fermi energy, will tend to recede from each other. For example, in the case of Sn, Cooper pair partners are expected to be at the antipodes\footnote{While not profiting completely from the latitude given by Cooper's mean square radius $\xi$, they do the best in the strong ``external'' mean field they are subject to, eventually displaying a non-negligible amount of spill out.}, in keeping with the fact that $\xi\approx14$ fm, and $R_0\approx$ 6 fm.

This expectation is not confirmed by studies of the Cooper pair wavefunction\footnote{See footnote \ref{C4f17} of this Chapter.} or better, its modulus squared, which indicated that in going from situation (a) to situation (b), Cooper pair partners come close to each other, if nothing else because of angular correlation (see Sect. \ref{app3D}). A result which is also valid for systems with two nucleons outside closed shells. 


In hindsight, one can posit that this result has to be interpreted with care in connection   with the experiments associated with the specific probe\footnote{On the other hand, to learn about  the structure of the Cooper pair subject to the single-particle potential acting as a strong external field, one can carry out electron scattering experiments or ($p,pn$) knockout reactions at high energies. Something that is also true for $^{11}$Li. Not particularly because of confinement, but because of spatial quantization, in keeping with the fact that the components $\ket{s_{1/2}^2(0)}$ and $\ket{p_{1/2}^2(0)}$ of  $\ket{gs(^{11}\text{Li})}$ have similar amplitudes, and of the symmetry relations of the spherical harmonics discussed in Sect. \ref{app3D}. In particular in the text following Eq. (\ref{eq11App3E}).  Within this scenario see the exhaustive discussion in \cite{Kubota:20}; see also \cite{Hansen:87}; \cite{Bertsch:91}; \cite{Esbensen:97}; \cite{Matsuo:05}; \cite{Hagino:05}; \cite{Matsuo:06}; \cite{Hagino:07,Sagawa:07,Hagino:07b,Matsuo:13}.} of Cooper pair correlations, namely two-nucleon transfer reactions, in which case the closest quantity to be observable is the two-nucleon transfer formfactor (Sect. \ref{S6.5.4}).
 The soundness of picture (b) (Fig. \ref{fig3.2.1}) gets also support from  the fact that one- and two-particle transfer  absolute cross sections have similar values\footnote{\label{f24} See footnote \ref{f28} Ch. \ref{chapter1}. See also Eq. (\ref{eq4.2.12}) and following text, as well as Sect. \ref{S7.3}.}. 


 Within this context we note that the fact that $^9_3$Li$_6$ is well bound ($N=6$  parity-inverted closed shell), $^{10}_3$Li$_7$ is not while $^{11}_3$Li$_8$ is again bound, indicates that we are confronted with a pairing phenomenon. Allowing the two neutrons moving outside $N=6$ closed shell to correlate in the configurations $j^2(0)\, (s_{1/2}^2, p_{1/2}^2, d_{5/2}^2\dots)$ through a short range bare pairing interaction, e.g. the $v_{14}$ Argonne $NN$-potential\footnote{\cite{Wiringa:84}.}, does not lead to a bound state. The system lowers the relative momentum of the pair by exchanging  the low-lying dipole vibration (soft $E1$ mode, pygmy resonance)\footnote{\cite{Broglia:19}.} of the associated diffuse system becoming, eventually, bound, ever so weakly ($S_{2n}=380$ MeV). The radius of the resulting system ($R(^{11}$Li)=$4.58\pm 0.13$ fm) corresponds, in the parametrization $R_0=1.2 A^{1/3}$ fm, to an effective mass number $A\approx 60$. So undoubtedly the system has swelled in moving from $A=9$ single closed shell system to the $A=11$ two-nucleon pair correlated outside closed shell, in a manner that goes beyond the $1.2A^{1/3}$ (fm) expected dependence. Although the correlation length of the neutron Cooper is restricted to a spherical volume of diameter $2\times R(^{11}$Li)$\approx 9.2$ fm, half of the estimated value of the correlation length \idx{Cooper pair!--confinement (by an external field)}
  $\xi\approx 20$ \idx{Halo (single Cooper pair) nucleus $^{11}$Li!correlation length}
   fm (see App. \ref{App6H}), it is almost double as large as $2\times R_0(^{11}$Li)$\approx 5.4$ fm. Consequently, the function $(|\Psi_0(\mathbf r_1,\mathbf r_2)|^2)$ displayed  in Fig. \ref{fig1F3} (II) b) should be read with care.

It will be surprising if the above mentioned  bootstrap-like mechanism \idx{Halo (single Cooper pair) nucleus $^{11}$Li!symbiotic (bootstrap) mechanism to break gauge invariance}
 (see Fig. \ref{fig1.9.1})  namely that of profiting from  low, unstable, nuclear densities to generate transient medium polarization effects to stabilize a Cooper pair halo system, was a unique property of $^{11}$Li. In fact, one can expect  situations of $s$ and $p$ states at threshold eventually leading to a symbiotic halo Cooper pair with a small value of $S_{2n}$, also in connection with  nuclear excited states. 





 
Within the bootstrap ansatz of symbiotic Cooper pair binding, we introduce a  generalization of the Axel-Brink\footnote{Namely, the hypothesis that on top of each excited level of the nuclear spectrum is built a GDR equal to that built on the ground state; \cite{Axel:62,Brink:55}).} hypothesis based on  well established experimental    results. Namely the fact that the line shape and thus also the percentage of EWSR per energy interval as well as the decay properties of the GDR will reflect the  adiabatic (inhomogeneous damping) and dynamic (motional narrowing) deformation properties of the state on which the GDR is built upon\footnote{\cite{LeTourneaux:65,Bohr:75,Bortignon:98} and refs. therein. See also \cite{Dattagupta:87}.}.

In the case of halo nuclei, the above mentioned generalization is both qualitative and  quantitative. A sensible fraction of the TRK sum rule is found almost degenerate with the ground state. From the ``elastic'' antenna-like response typical of the high energy GDR ($\hbar\omega_{GDR}\approx80\text{MeV}/A^{1/3}$)  one is now confronted with a ``plastic'', low energy ($\lesssim$1 MeV, $\Gamma\approx0.5$ MeV)  pygmy dipole resonance (PDR) or soft $E1$-mode\footnote{See footnote \ref{f119C2} of Ch. \ref{intro}.} where pairing, i.e. Cooper pairs, play an important role. Regarding the consequences this phenomenon has for the $L=1$ induced interaction between nucleons, one moves from dipole-dipole (static moment interactions, effective charges) to dispersive (retarded) contributions, emerging essentially from quantum mechanical ZPF\footnote{Within this context, see \cite{Bohr:75}, Sect. 6-5 f p. 432.}. As already expressed, it is this second one which dominates the van der Waals interaction \idx{Cooper pair!van der Waals}
 (Sect. \ref{C2SG2}) and, similarly, it is one which can lead to an almost resonant (PDR) gluing of Cooper pair halos (see Eq. \ref{eq17App1E}). Resonant mechanism, phonons in this case,  found  at the basis of superconductivity in metals (see Eq. (\ref{eqC2AppA23}) and  following discussion). 

  The energy centroid, the width and the percentage of the TRK sum rule (EWSR) of dipole resonances can be strongly affected by nuclear dynamical fluctuations and deformations which, in turn, depend on pairing, and thus on Cooper pairs. Because of angular momentum conservation, such phenomenon is restricted in lowest order, to fluctuations and deformations of quadrupole and monopole type. In the case of $^{11}$Li, to an isotropic radial deformation, build up by the two less bound neutrons. This highly extended, low-momentum neutron halo, vibrating out of phase against the nucleons of the core ($^9$Li), gives rise to the soft $E1$-mode (PDR)\footnote{\cite{Broglia:19} and refs. therein.}.  It can be viewed as the taylored glue \idx{Halo (single Cooper pair) nucleus $^{11}$Li!isotropic radial deformation}
   which, exchanged between the halo neutrons, bind the resulting neutron halo Cooper pair to the core\footnote{\cite{Barranco:01}.}.


The challenges faced in trying to learn about the physical basis of pairing in nuclei are comparable to those encountered to extract a   collective vibration from a background much larger than the signal, as it was the case  in the discovery of the GDR in hot nuclei\footnote{\cite{Snover:86,Gaardhoje:85,Gaardhoje:86}. See also \cite{Bortignon:98} Figs. 1.4 and 6.8, and refs. therein.}$^,$\footnote{A statement which becomes more than an analogy in connection with the nuclear analogue to the (ac) Josephson effect proposed in \cite{Potel:20b,yy} (Potel Josephson $\gamma$), which can eventually be tested by extracting a dipole $\gamma$-signal of Josephson frequency $\nu_J=Q_{2n}/h$ (or better, that of the somehow higher peaked $\gamma$-strength function, energy shifted by the $\gamma$-phase space volume element), from a continuum plus discrete lines background.}. In trying to observe  pairing effects in nuclei close to the ground state, one has the advantage to start with the system at zero temperature for free. On the other hand one needs to substract the very large, state dependent effects of the ``external'' mean field, a challenge not second to that faced by condensed matter practitioners to study low-temperature superconductivity in general, and the Josephson effect in particular.  Within this context, $^{11}$Li provides a textbook example of the fact that, given the possibility\footnote{\label{f39C4} Namely, the presence of normal density. A feature which in the present case goes hand in hand with the presence of abnormal density (single Cooper pair).}, nucleon pair partners recede from each other, lowering in the process the momentum of relative motion and thus the confinement kinetic \idx{Halo (single Cooper pair) nucleus $^{11}$Li!binding through deconfinement}
 energy\footnote{\label{f40C4} That is, from $\hbar^2/(m(2r_0)^2)\approx 7$ MeV $(r_0=1.2$ fm) to $\hbar^2/(m(2R(^{11}\text{Li}))^2)\approx 0.5$ MeV ($R$($^{11}$Li)$\approx$4.6 fm; within this context it is of notice that the overlap between radial wavefunctions of the halo neutrons and of those of the core is $\mathcal O=(R_0/R)^3\approx0.2$  see Fig. \ref{fig1.9.1}; see also \cite{Broglia:19b}). While the system looses in this way a consistent fraction of the bare, short range pairing interaction through screening, it opens up for long-range pairing contributions which, ever so weak, can still bind the halo Cooper pair to the core. In other words, symbiotic binding by  deconfinement (note that the correlation length expected to be operative in the case of a two-neutron transfer process in a heavy ion collision is estimated to be $\xi\approx20$ fm; \idx{Halo (single Cooper pair) nucleus $^{11}$Li!correlation length} see Eq. (\ref{eq3.6.12})). In the case of superconducting metals, the correlation length is $\xi\approx 10^4$ \AA, a distance to be compared to the Wigner-Seitz radius of $\approx$ 2\AA. This variation leads to a decrease of the Coulomb repulsion by almost 4 orders of magnitude. From $U_c=e^2/r=14.4\times$ eV$\times$\AA/(2\AA)=7.2 eV to $U_c=14.4$ eV\AA/($10^4$\AA)=1.4 meV.}, allowing to extend the limits of stability of nuclear species through a subtle long range pairing mechanism. 

Concerning the fact that the role of pairing increases for weakly bound nuclei far from stability and the fact that some nuclei turn out to be bound only due to pairing see \cite{Zelevinsky:04}\footnote{Within this context and regarding a powerful method to treat pairing, based on the quasispin symmetry, see \cite{Volya:01} and \cite{Zelevinsky:03}.}




\section[Correlations in Cooper pair tunneling]{Correlations between nucleons in Cooper pair tunneling}\label{C3S3}
Let us call $x_1$ and $x_2$ the coordinates of the Cooper pair partners. Let us furthermore assume they can only take two values: 0 when they are bound to the target nucleus, 1 when they have tunneled and become part of the outgoing particle (see Fig. \ref{fig3.3.1}).
\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics*[width=0.7\textwidth,angle=0]{nutshell/figs/fig3_3_1.pdf}}
\caption{A schematic representation of nucleon tunneling between target and projectile. The free energy $F=U-TS$ which for the zero temperature situation under consideration coincides with the potential energy as a function of the nucleon coordinate $x$. For $x=0$ the nucleon is assumed to be bound to the target system. For $x=1$ the nucleon has undergone tunneling becoming bound to the outgoing particle. In other words $x_1$ jumps from the value 0 to the value 1 in the tunneling process ($x, 0\rightarrow 1$), the same for the coordinate of the second nucleon.}\label{fig3.3.1}
\end{figure}

The correlation between the two nucleons is measured by the value\footnote{\cite{Basdevant:05}.}
\begin{align}
\langle x_1x_2\rangle-\langle x_1\rangle\langle x_2\rangle=\int d \gamma P_2\times 1\times1-\int d \gamma P_1\times 1\int d \gamma' P_1'\times 1=P_2-P_1P_1',
\end{align}
$d\gamma$ being the differential volume in phase space, normalized with respect to the corresponding standard deviations, that is, with respect to
\begin{align}
\sigma_{x_1}\sigma_{x_2}=\left[\left(\langle x_1^2\rangle-\langle x_1\rangle^2\right)\left(\langle x_2^2\rangle-\langle x_2\rangle^2\right)\right]^{1/2}.
\end{align}
Making use of the fact that
\begin{align}
\langle x_1^2\rangle=\int d \gamma P_1\times 1^2=P_1,
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
\langle x_1\rangle=\int d \gamma P_1\times 1=P_1,
\end{align}
one can calculate the function which measures the correlations between nucleons 1 and 2, namely,
\begin{align}
Corr=\frac{\langle x_1x_2\rangle-\langle x_1\rangle\langle x_2\rangle}{\sqrt{\left(\langle x_1^2\rangle-\langle x_1\rangle^2\right)\left(\langle x_2^2\rangle-\langle x_2\rangle^2\right)}}=\frac{P_2-P_1P_1'}{\sqrt{\left(P_1-P_1^2\right)\left(P_1'-P_1^{'2}\right)}}.
\end{align}
Because both nucleons are identical and thus interchangeable, $P_1=P_1'$. Thus
\begin{align}
Corr=\frac{P_2-P_1^2}{P_1-P_1^2}.
\end{align}
Making use of the empirical values
\begin{align}
P_1\approx P_2\approx 10^{-3}
\end{align}
leads to,
\begin{align}\label{eq3.3.8}
Corr=\frac{10^{-3}-10^{-6}}{10^{-3}-10^{-6}}\approx 1.
\end{align}



In other words, within the Cooper pair motion regime, nucleon partners are solidly anchored (entangled) to each other: if one nucleon goes over, the other does it also. This is so in spite of the very liable and fragile (intrinsic) structure of the nuclear Cooper pairs $(2\Delta/\epsilon_F\ll1)$. An example of such a  scenario is  provided by $^{11}$Li. In fact, if one picks--up a neutron from $^{11}$Li ($^{11}$Li($p,d)^{10}$Li), the other one breaks up essentially instantaneously, $^{10}$Li being unbound (Sect. \ref{S5.2.4}). In spite of this fact, the probability associated with the reaction $^1$H($^{11}$Li,$^9$Li(gs))$^{3}$H is given by\footnote{See  Fig. \ref{fig8_1_2}, Sect. \ref{C8AppB} regarding the experimental values, and Table \ref{tab8_B_1} concerning the theoretical ones of \mbox{$\sigma(^{11}\text{Li}\to ^{9}\text{Li (gs)})$}, and \cite{Kobayashi:89} concerning the experimental value of $R(^{11}$Li). See also paragraph following Eq. (\ref{eq2.F.5}).}
\begin{align}\label{eq3.3.9}
P_2=\frac{(5.7\pm0.9)\text{ mb}}{2\pi((4.58\pm0.13)\text{ fm})^2}\approx(4.3\pm1)10^{-3}. \idx{Two-nucleon transfer!one- and two-particle transfer probabilities}
\end{align}
This value is of the order of that associated with the breakup process mentioned above\footnote{It is of notice that the value given in Eq. (\ref{eq3.3.9}) essentially coincides with that shown in the $l=0$, column \textbf{1} of  Table \ref{tab8_B_1}.}, and reported in  Table \ref{tab3.3.1}.

  \end{table}

 The fact that $P_2\approx P_1$  contained in the relation (\ref{eq3.2.19}), is applicable both for static and dynamic pairing modes, is  in keeping with the fact that in nuclei dynamic spontaneous breaking of gauge invariance, is of similar importance as the static one\footnote{See also Fig. 4 of \cite{Potel:13b}.} (see Figs. \ref{fig1_E8} and \ref{fig3.3.2}). 








\section{Pair transfer}\label{trans_nutAppA}
In the semi-classical approximation, the second order two-nucleon transfer amplitude can be written as (see Eq. (\ref{A3})), 
\begin{equation}\label{eq.4.5.1x}
a(t = + \infty) = a^{(1)}(\infty) - a^{(NO)}(\infty) + \tilde a^{(2)} ( \infty),
\end{equation}
where $a^{(1)}(\infty)=a^{(1)}_{sim}$ and $\tilde a^{(2)} (\infty)=a^{(2)}_{succ}$ describe the simultaneous and successive transfer amplitudes respectively.
   In the \textbf{independent particle limit}, these amplitudes fulfill the relations\footnote{see Sect. \ref{C7AppC}, also \cite{Potel:13}.},

\begin{equation}
a_{sim}^{(1)}=a_{NO}^{(1)},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
a_{succ}^{(2)}=a_{one-part}^{(1)}\times a_{one-part}^{(1)},
\end{equation}
\vspace{0.2cm}
with
\begin{equation}
a+A\rightarrow f+F \rightarrow b+B,
\end{equation}         
corresponding to the product of two single nucleon transfer amplitudes.
On the other hand, in the \textbf{strong correlation limit} one can write, making use of the
post-prior representation
\begin{equation}
 a_{succ}^{(2)}= \tilde a_{succ}^{(2)}-a_{NO}^{(1)},
\end{equation}
relation which fulfills,
\begin{equation}
\lim_{E_{corr}\rightarrow \infty}  a_{succ}^{(2)}=0.
\end{equation}
That is, the transfer process is, in this case, associated with  simultaneous transfer.
Actual nuclei are close to the independent particle limit $(E_{corr}\approx$(2--3 MeV) $\ll \epsilon_F(\approx$ 36 MeV)).  Successive transfer is thus expected to be the major contribution to pair transfer processes. But successive transfer seems to break the pair \textit{right?} \textit{Wrong}. \textit{Why?} let us see below.
\subsection{Cooper pair dimensions}\label{S3.4.1}
 At the basis of the relations used to estimate  the dimensions of a Cooper pair (correlation length; mean square radius) one finds 
\begin{equation}
\delta x\delta p\ge \hbar\quad \delta\epsilon\approx |E_{corr}|,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\epsilon=\frac{p^2}{2m};\quad\delta\epsilon=\frac{p\delta p}{m}\approx v_F\delta p,
\end{equation}
and thus 
\begin{equation}
\delta\epsilon\approx  |E_{corr}|\approx v_F\delta p,
\end{equation}
leading to
\begin{equation}\label{eq3.4.9}
\xi\approx\delta x\approx\frac{\hbar}{\delta p}\approx \frac{\hbar v_F}{ |E_{corr}|}\quad \text{(correlation length)}. \idx{Cooper pair!--mean square radius (correlation length)}
\end{equation}
In what follows we use, for normal systems, 
\begin{equation}
\xi=\frac{\hbar v_F}{ \pi|E_{corr}|},
\end{equation}
and, in the case of open shell superfluid nuclei\footnote{So called Pippard correlation length. See \cite{Schrieffer:64} p. 18 and 34,  \cite{Annett:13} p. 62.}
\begin{equation}\label{eq4.5.11}
\xi=\frac{\hbar v_F}{ \pi\Delta}.
\end{equation}
For Sn-isotopes, a typical value of the pairing gap is $\Delta\approx 1.2$ MeV. Making use of $k_F=1.36$ fm$^{-1}$ associated with nuclei lying along the stability valley, and thus ($v_F/c\approx 0.2 (k_F)_{\text{fm}^{-1}}\approx0.27$),
\begin{equation}
\xi\approx14\text{ fm}.
\end{equation}

\end{figure}


Consequently, successive and simultaneous transfer can feel equally well the pairing correlations giving rise to long range order\footnote{See footnote \ref{f37c1} Ch. \ref{introduction}; see also e.g. \cite{Potel:17} and references therein.}. This virtual property can become real in e.g. a pair transfer between two superfluid nuclei\footnote{See \cite{Oertzen:13,vonOertzen:01,Weiss:79}; for a more recent experimental and theoretical study see \cite{Montanari:14,Montanari:16}.}, in particular two tin isotopes (see Figs. \ref{fig_gamma} and \ref{fig_1}; see also Sect. \ref{S7.3} with regards to the reaction between superfluid Sn- and Ni-isotopes).
\subsection*{Objection}
What about $v_{pairing}(=G)$ becoming zero, e.g. between the two nuclei?
\subsection*{Answer}
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\sigma(a(=b+2)+A\rightarrow b+B(=A+2))}{d\Omega}\sim |\alpha_0|^2,

\begin{equation}\label{eqtrans_nut1}
\alpha_0=\langle BCS(A+2) |P^\dagger|BCS(A)\rangle=\sum_{\nu>0}U_{\nu}(A)V_{\nu}(A+2).
\end{equation}
That is, pair transfer does not depend explicitly but only functionally on $G$.

Relation (\ref{eqtrans_nut1}) is only valid for simultaneous transfer, \textit{right?} \textit{Wrong}.

where the (inverse) quasiparticle transformation relation $a^{\dagger}_\nu=U_{\nu}\alpha^{\dagger}_{\nu}+V_{\nu}\alpha_{\bar{\nu}}$ was used\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Brink:05} App. G.}. Examples of  two--nucleon spectroscopic amplitudes involving superfluid targets, namely those associated with the reactions $^{112}$Sn($p,t)^{110}$Sn(gs) and\\ $^{124}$Sn($p,t)^{122}$Sn(gs) are given in Table \ref{tab1D1} (see also Table \ref{tab8_2_1}). Making use of some of these amplitudes (first column of Table \ref{tab1D1}) and of global optical parameters (Table \ref{tab8.2.2}), the two-nucleon transfer absolute differential cross section of the reaction $^{112}$Sn($p,t)^{110}$Sn(gs) at a bombarding energy of $E_p=26$ MeV, was calculated making use of the software \textsc{cooper} based on second order DWBA and taking into account successive and simultaneous transfer properly corrected for non-orthogonality (cf. Chapter \ref{C7} and App. \ref{C8AppD}). It is compared with experimental data in Fig. \ref{fig_2A2} (a). The corresponding absolute integrated cross sections are 1310 $\mu$b and 1309$\pm 200 \,\mu$b respectively. The largest contribution to the cross section  arise from successive transfer, the cancellation between simultaneous and non-orthogonality amplitudes being important (Fig. \ref{fig_2A2} (b)). The above provides a typical example of results of a systematic study of two-nucleon transfer reactions in terms of absolute cross sections\footnote{\cite{Potel:13}, \cite{Potel:13b}.} (Figs. \ref{fig1.5} and  \ref{fig8_2_4}).




 Making use of two-nucleon spectroscopic amplitudes worked out within the framework of an extended shell model calculation (Table \ref{tab1D1}, second column) one obtains very similar results to those displayed in Fig. \ref{fig_2A2} (a). In Fig. \ref{fig_2A3} we report results similar to those displayed in Fig. \ref{fig_2A2}, but for the case of the reaction $^{124}$Sn($p,t)^{122}$Sn(gs) calculated within second order DWBA making use of the BCS spectroscopic amplitudes (Table \ref{tab1D1} third column).

The theoretical cross sections were calculated making use of the spectroscopic amplitudes given in Tables \ref{tab1E2} and \ref{tab1E3} and of global optical parameters as reported in the reference above. Both  RPA and TD amplitudes were used in the calculations as well as a pure configuration $p_{1/2}^2(0)$. \idx{Cooper pair!--absolute transfer cross sections ($\sigma_{2n}$)}
   \idx{Two-nucleon transfer!absolute differential cross sections (unifying structure+reactions)!$^{206}$Pb($t,p$)$^{208}$Pb} }\label{fig2A4}
    \end{figure}

Let us now discuss an example of two-nucleon transfer around a closed shell nucleus displaying well defined collective pairing vibrational modes. We refer, in particular, to the pair removal mode of $^{206}$Pb, that is, to the reaction, $^{206}$Pb$(t,p)$$^{208}$Pb(gs). Making use of the spectroscopic amplitudes displayed in Tables \ref{tab1E2} and \ref{tab1E3} and of global optical parameters, the associated  absolute differential cross section was calculated  with the software \textsc{cooper}. It is displayed in Fig. \ref{fig2A4} in comparison with the experimental findings. In  the same figure, the absolute total differential cross section is compared with that associated with the TD (Tamm-Dancoff) description of $^{206}$Pb(gs), that is, setting the pairing ground state correlations to zero ($\sum_i X^2_r(i)=1, Y_r(k)\equiv 0$, see Table \ref{tab1E2}). In this case, theory underpredicts observation by about a factor of 2.  Also given in Fig. \ref{fig2A4} is the predicted cross section associated with the pure configuration $|p_{1/2}^{-2}(0)\rangle$. 


It is of notice, that within the effective reaction mechanism described in Sect. \ref{C7AppB} pairing correlations increase the value of $\Omega_0(\approx 0.97)$. As a consequence the   $l=n=0$ two-neutron system gives a consistently larger contribution to the two-nucleon transfer process than those associated with $n=1$ and 2, that is those proportional to $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ whose values are 0.25 and 0.06 respectively (cf. Eq. (\ref{5lec13})). All these features boost the effective absolute two--nucleon  transfer cross section. While the results displayed in Fig. \ref{fig2A4} were calculated making use of the full formalism of second order DWBA (Figs. \ref{fig_alpha} and \ref{fig_beta}) the simplified expressions given in Eqs. (\ref{5lec1}--\ref{5lec3}) and (\ref{5lec13}--\ref{eqC7B15}) were useful to gain physical insight into the effective  two-nucleon transfer formfactors $u^{J_iJ_f}_{LSJ}f(R)$. In fact, these functions, multiplied by the factors $D_0$, provided a simple parametrization to account for the absolute two-nucleon transfer  differential cross sections. \emph{On the other hand, they were a source of misunderstanding concerning the reaction mechanism of two-nucleon transfer\footnote{For more (historic) details see \cite{Bohr:19} (Overview).}}.



Collective surface vibrations of closed shell nuclei can be viewed as correlated particle-hole excitations. The phase coherence existing between the different RPA amplitudes of the corresponding wavefunction leads to a decrease of the average distance (angular correlation) between the particle and the hole, as compared with pure $ph$-configurations, similar to what happens in pair addition (substraction) modes\footnote{Concerning this parallel see Fig. \ref{fig3B3x}; see also Fig. 7 of \cite{Barranco:19b}.},  in which case are the $pp\;(hh)$ which angular correlate with each other.\idx{Cooper pair!--angular correlation} It has been argued that this is the reason why both pairing and surface vibrations of closed shell nuclei display enhanced $(t,p)$ cross sections as compared to pure configurations\footnote{\cite{Bertsch:67}.}. In the triton, the two neutrons lie rather close to each other.


In the case of collective surface vibrations of closed shell nuclei, like e.g. the octupole vibration of $^{208}$Pb ($E_x=2.65$ MeV), the specific probe is not two--nucleon transfer, but Coulomb excitation or inelastic scattering,  the wavelength of the $\gamma$-ray associated with the corresponding electromagnetic decay being $\lambda\approx 460$ fm. This is about two orders of magnitude larger than nuclear dimensions. Within this scenario, whether  the particle is angle correlated with the hole or less in the collective (RPA) state, as compared to a pure $p-h$ state can hardly be of any relevance to explain  the enhancement of the absolute transition probability ($B(E3)=32$ Bsp) of the particle-hole correlated state, one of the largest of the whole mass table. Not only this, it sets a question mark on the validity of the argument as applied to Cooper pair transfer and pairing correlations. This question is taken up in Sects.  
\ref{App3B}--\ref{C3AppE}.








\section{Weak link between superconductors}\label{C3AppC}
\idx{Weak link between superconductors}
\idx{Josephson effect!weakly coupled superconductors}
Two-nucleon transfer reactions involving superfluid nuclei display some similarities with Cooper pair tunneling between weakly coupled superconductors, in particular when discussing heavy ion reactions, but not only\footnote{\cite{Goldanskii:68,Dietrich:70,Dietrich:71,Hara:71,Kleber:71,Weiss:79}, \cite{vonOertzen:01,Oertzen:13,Broglia:04a}.}. Within this context it is useful to remind the basic elements of the pair tunneling which is at the basis of the Josephson effect. 
In this section we essentially reproduce the description of the tunneling of Cooper pairs between two weakly coupled superconductors to be found in\footnote{\cite{Anderson:64b}}, likely the best physical presentation of the Josephson effect\footnote{\cite{Josephson:62}.}.


One starts with the many-body Hamiltonian\footnote{\cite{Cohen:62}}
\begin{align}\label{eq3.C.1}
H=H_1+H_2+\sum_{kq}T_{kq}(a_{k\uparrow}^\dagger a_{q\uparrow}+a_{-q\downarrow}^\dagger a_{-k\downarrow})+hc \idx{Weak link between superconductors!tunneling Hamiltonian}
\end{align}
where $H_1$ and $H_2$ are the separate Hamiltonians of the two superconductors on each side of the junction, $T_{kq}$ being the (exponentially) small tunneling matrix element from state $k$ on one side to state $q$ on the other.


One can arrive to  (\ref{eq3.C.1}) by first finding sets of single--particle wavefunctions for each side separately, in the absence of the potential of the other system. \textit{Then one eliminates the non-orthogonality effects by perturbation theory (cf. the similarity with the arguments used in Sect. \ref{C2S1} to introduce the two-nucleon transfer amplitudes in (2nd order) DWBA; see also App. \ref{App1.D}, Eq. (\ref{eq1.D.25})}). A nuclear embodiment of such strategy\footnote{\label{f45}Because  pairing vibrations in nuclei are quite collective, leading to effective $U$ and $V$ occupation factor (cf. Fig. \ref{fig3.3.2}) (see also \cite{Potel:13b}), the nuclear and the condensed matter expressions for Cooper tunneling processes are very similar. Of course no supercurrent is expected between nuclei. However, the systems $^{120}$Sn(gs), $^{119}$Sn($j$), $^{118}$Sn(gs) form an ensemble of weakly coupled Fermi superfluids, with different (average) number of particles ($N,N-1,N-2$), to which essentially all the BCS techniques, including those of the present Section can be applied.} is worked out in Ch. \ref{C7} (see in particular Sect. \ref{S6.2.9} and Sect. \ref{C7AppC}) and was implemented in the code \textsc{cooper}\footnote{Cf. App. \ref{C8AppD}; cf. also \cite{Broglia:04a}.}. 


At the basis of the Josephson effect one find $P_2\approx P_1$ which, in the nuclear case implies $\sigma_{2p}\approx\sigma_{1p}$ (see Sect. \ref{S4.3}; also footnote \ref{f28} Ch. \ref{chapter1}). A remarkable finding  valid also whether only one of the two interacting systems belongs to a  pairing vibrational band, or is superfluid. This is because of the importance of pairing vibrations in nuclei as compared to superconductors. Similar results are found in the case in which both systems are superfluid, namely in the case of  one- and two-nucleon transfer reactions in a heavy ion collision between superfluid nuclei (see Ch. \ref{C8})\footnote{Note that in the case of a heavy ion collision between two superfluid nuclei at energies below the Coulomb barrier, one compares gs$\to$gs with gs$\to$qp, summed over a number of qp states (see Sect. \ref{S7.3}).}. 
It is likely that the results obtained in this case at bombarding energies of few MeV below the Coulomb barrier, come closest to the tunneling phenomena observed between two weakly coupled superconductors.

Let us now calculate the second order expression of  (\ref{eq3.C.1}) in the case in which the gaps of the two weakly linked superconductors are different.
Making use of  relations presented in\footnote{See also App. G \cite{Brink:05}.} Sects. \ref{S1.4.2} and \ref{trans_nutAppA} one can write, for $T=0$,
\begin{align}\label{eq3.C.2}
\Delta E_2=-2\sum_{kq}|T_{kq}|^2\frac{|V_kU_q+V_qU_k|^2}{E_k+E_q}.
\end{align}
With the help of 
\begin{align}\label{eq3.C.3}
2U_kV_k^*=\frac{\Delta_k}{E_k},\quad 2U_qV_q^*=\frac{\Delta_q}{E_q},
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
|U_k|^2-|V_k|^2=\frac{\epsilon_k}{E_k},\quad |U_q|^2-|V_q|^2=\frac{\epsilon_q}{E_q},
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
E=\sqrt{\epsilon^2+\Delta^2},
\end{align}
and\footnote{Note the difference in gauge phasing used in this section to follow that of \cite{Anderson:64b} as compared with that used in the rest of the monograph.}
\begin{align}\label{eq3.C.6}
\Delta_k=\Delta_1e^{i\phi_1},\quad \Delta_q=\Delta_2e^{i\phi_2},
\end{align}
one can write for the numerator of Eq. (\ref{eq3.C.2}),
\begin{align}\label{eq3.C.5}
\nonumber NUM=&\left(V_kU_q+V_qU_k\right)\left(V^*_kU^*_q+V^*_qU^*_k\right)\\
&=\left\{V^2_kU^2_q+V^2_qU^2_k\right\}+\left[(U_k^*V_k)(U_qV^*_q)+(U_q^*V_q)(U_kV^*_k)\right].
\end{align}
It is of notice that, for simplicity, throughout this section
\begin{align}
V^2\equiv|V|^2.
\end{align}
With the help of (\ref{eq3.C.3}) the expression in the squared bracket in (\ref{eq3.C.5}) can be written as 
\begin{align}\label{eq3.C.9}
[\;]=\frac{1}{4E_kE_q}\left(\Delta_k^*\Delta_q+(\Delta_k^*\Delta_q)^*\right)=\frac{1}{4E_kE_q}2\Re(\Delta_k^*\Delta_q).
\end{align}
Making use of the relations
\begin{align}
\nonumber \left(U_k^2-V_k^2\right)&\left(U_q^2-V_q^2\right)=U_k^2U_q^2-U_k^2V_q^2-V_k^2U_q^2+V_k^2V_q^2\\
&=-\left(U_k^2V_q^2+V_k^2U_q^2\right)+\left(U_k^2U_q^2+V_k^2V_q^2\right),
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
\nonumber 1=\left(U_k^2+V_k^2\right)&\left(U_q^2+V_q^2\right)=U_k^2U_q^2+U_k^2V_q^2+V_k^2U_q^2+V_k^2V_q^2\\
&=\left(U_k^2V_q^2+V_k^2U_q^2\right)+\left(U_k^2U_q^2+V_k^2V_q^2\right),
\end{align}
one obtains,
\begin{align}
1-\left(U_k^2-V_k^2\right)\left(U_q^2-V_q^2\right)=2\left(U_k^2V_q^2+V_k^2U_q^2\right),
\end{align}
that is, twice the expression written in curly brackets in (\ref{eq3.C.5}). Consequently
\begin{align}\label{eq3.C.13}
\left\{\vphantom{\left(U_q^2-V_q^2\right)}\;\;\right\}=\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\left(U_k^2-V_k^2\right)\left(U_q^2-V_q^2\right)\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{\epsilon_k\epsilon_q}{E_kE_q}\right).
\end{align}
Thus, the sum of (\ref{eq3.C.9}) and (\ref{eq3.C.13}) leads to,
\begin{align}
NUM=\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{\epsilon_k\epsilon_q}{E_kE_q}+\frac{\Re(\Delta_q^*\Delta_k)}{E_kE_q}\right)
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
\Delta E_2=-\sum_{kq}\frac{|T_{kq}|^2}{E_k+E_q}\left(1-\frac{\epsilon_k\epsilon_q}{E_kE_q}+\frac{\Re(\Delta_q^*\Delta_k)}{E_kE_q}\right).
\end{align}
In what follows, we concentrate in the gauge phase-dependent term. 




With the help of (\ref{eq3.C.6}) one can write
\begin{align}
\Delta_k\Delta_q^*=\Delta_1\Delta_2e^{i(\phi_1-\phi_2)}=\Delta_1\Delta_2\left(\cos(\phi_1-\phi_2)+i\sin(\phi_1-\phi_2)\right).
\end{align}
Thus
\begin{align}
\Re\Delta_k\Delta_q^*=\Delta_1\Delta_2\cos(\phi_1-\phi_2),
\end{align}
where $\Re$ stands for real part. Making use of
\begin{align}
\sum_k\rightarrow N_1\int d\epsilon_1,\quad\sum_q\rightarrow N_2\int d\epsilon_2
\end{align}
where $N_1$ and $N_2$ are the density of levels of one spin orientation at the Fermi energy one  obtains\footnote{It is of notice that $\Delta E_2$ is bilinear in the density of levels (see \cite{Potel:17}).}
\begin{align}\label{eq3.6.19}
\nonumber\Delta E_2&\approx-N_1N_2\Delta_1 \Delta_2 \langle|T_{kq}|^2\rangle \cos(\phi_1-\phi_2)\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{d\epsilon_1 d\epsilon_2}{E_1 E_2(E_1+E_2)}\\
&\approx -2\pi N_1 N_2 \langle|T_{kq}|^2\rangle \cos(\phi_1-\phi_2)\times \left(\pi\frac{\Delta_1\Delta_2}{\Delta_1+\Delta_2}\right). \idx{Josephson effect!reduced pairing gap} \idx{Weak link between superconductors!tunneling interaction (second order)}
\end{align}
Replacing the phase difference in (\ref{eq3.6.19}) by the gauge-invariant phase difference $\gamma=(\phi_1-\phi_2)-\frac{2e}{\hbar}\int_1^2\mathbf A\cdot d\pmb \ell$, where $\mathbf A$ is the magnetic vector potential ($\pmb\nabla\times\mathbf A=\mathbf B$), and the line integral is carried across the barrier of thickness $d$ ($\int_1^2d\ell=d$), one can calculate the supercurrent\footnote{\idx{Josephson effect!reduced pairing gap}
	\label{f57C4} $J_0=\frac{1}{d}\left(\delta(\Delta E_2)/\delta\mathbf A\right)=\left(4\pi  e^2/\hbar\right)N_aN_A\langle|T|^2\rangle\times\left( \pi(\Delta_a\Delta_A/e(\Delta_a+\Delta_A))\right)\sin\left((\phi_1-\phi_2)-\frac{2e}{\hbar}\int_1^2\mathbf A\cdot d\pmb \ell\right)$, where one has divided by the thickness of the barrier $d$, so as to obtain a supercurrent per unit area i.e. $J_0/S$. Thus $\langle|T|^2\rangle$ is assumed to be an energy squared per unit area.} whose maximum value for two identical superconductors is\footnote{\cite{Tinkham:96} Ch. 6, Eq. (6-4) and subsequent discussion; see also \cite{Anderson:64} Eq. (11) and following discussion.}
\begin{align}\label{eq4.7.20}

 is the  junction's resistance  multiplied by the   unit area ($S$, i.e. Ohm $\times\, S$)  when both metals are in the normal state, and $V_{equiv}=2\Delta/e$ is the minimum voltage at which a normal current $I_N$, upon the breaking of Cooper pairs, starts to flow\footnote{\cite{Giaver:73}.}. It is, within a factor $\pi/4$, \idx{Josephson effect!transfer (tunneling) probability} equal to the critical Josephson current $J_0$. This result is a consequence of  $P_2\approx P_1$ (see Eq. (\ref{eq3.2.19})), and provides experimental validation to the prediction.
  
  

  
As it emerges from Fig. \ref{fig4.6.1}, in which a bias of value $V\gtrsim2\Delta/e$ is applied to the barrier, transferred Cooper pairs are broken and quasiparticle excitations created --thus the labeling (S-Q)-- resulting in the flow of a normal (dissipative) current of carriers $q=e$. For $T=0$, one is in presence of processes connecting a ground state (S) with ground and excited states (Q). The importance of this fact in connection with the Josephson-like junction transiently formed in heavy ion reactions becomes apparent below (Sect. \ref{S7.3}).
  
  \begin{figure}

  	\caption{Current-voltage characteristic curves for tunneling between two metals across a barrier (thin oxide layer of 10--30\AA). It is assumed that both metals are  equal and that they can become superconductors at low temperature (e.g. Al-Al$_2$O$_3$-Al, Sn-SnO$_\text{x}$-Sn). \textbf{N-N} indicates the  current resulting from the \textit{tunneling of single electrons} between the metals, both of them in the normal phase. \textbf{S-Q} indicates the single-electron tunneling between two superconductors \textbf{(S-S)} when the barrier is subject to a potential difference (direct current bias) $V\gtrsim2\Delta/e$, in which case Cooper pairs are broken and quasiparticles \textbf{(Q)} become excited. \textbf{S-S} labels the (super) current associated with the \textit{tunneling of Cooper pairs} through the unbiased barrier ($V=0$, no potential loss). That is, the (dc) Josephson effect.

  \end{figure}
  
  For Pb and Sn, the gaps are 1.4 meV and 0.7 meV, leading to $e V_{equiv} \,(V_{equiv})\approx 2.8$ meV (2.8 mV) and 1.4 meV (1.4 mV) respectively. Assuming $R_b$ to be of the order of $1\Omega\,\times\, S$, implies maximum values of the Josephson supercurrent $J=J_0\sin\gamma$, of the order of $J_0\approx 2$ mA, as experimentally observed.
 
 
 It is suggestive that the expression (\ref{eq3.6.19}) is formally similar to that of the ion-ion potential acting between two heavy ions in weak contact, namely at a distance  a diffusivity away from th grazing distance $r_g$. In this case the role of the reduced gap is played by a quantity closely related to the reduced radius of curvature\footnote{\cite{Broglia:04a} p.114  Eq. (40), $U_{aA}^{N}(r)=-V_0/(1+\exp(\frac{r-R_0}{a}))$, $V_0=16\pi\gamma R_{aA}a$, $R_0=R_a+R_A+0.29$ fm, which for two $^{120}$Sn nuclei ($R=5.883$ fm) leads to $R_0\approx12.1$ fm and $V_0=83.8$ MeV. For energies somewhat above the Coulomb barrier, the grazing distance (Eq. (25) p. 128) of the above reference is $r_g=r_B-\delta\approx12.8$ fm ($r_B\approx$ 13.3 fm, $\delta\approx0.5$ fm). Thus $(1+\exp(\frac{r_g+a-R_0}{a}))\approx9.26$.}
 \begin{align}\label{eq3.6.22}
 U_{aA}^N(r_g+a)\sim -\gamma\frac{R_aR_A}{R_a+R_A}a.
 \end{align}
 In the above expression $\gamma\approx$ 0.9 MeV/fm$^2$ is the surface tension, $a=0.63$ fm the diffusivity of the potential, $R_i$(=(1.233$A^{1/3}-0.98A^{-1/3}$) fm) being the radii of nuclei $i=a,A$. For two identical nuclei $R_a=R_A=R$ and $V_0=8\pi\gamma R a$. In the case in which the interacting nuclei are two  $^{120}$Sn systems  $U_{aA}^N(r_g+a)=U_{aA}^N(13.43 \text{ fm})\approx-9.1$ MeV.
 
 
 
Being leptodermous systems, nuclei can be described at profit concerning a number of properties, with the help of the liquid drop. Because at the grazing distance the two leptodermous objects overlap, although weakly, two ``unit'' areas disappear. To reconstruct them one has to separate the two liquid drops until these areas are formed again. The energy needed to do so has to compensate for the value (\ref{eq3.6.22}).  Now, this quantity is a measure of the force that must be applied to surface molecules (nucleons) so that they experience the same situation as a molecule does when it is in the interior of the liquid (nucleus). 
  
   
 Similarly, the weak link (\ref{eq3.6.19}) between the two superconductors 1 and 2, is associated with the situations in which each partner of the Cooper pair which tunnels is in a different superconductor, a kind of incipient (covalent) phenomenon, the Cooper pair being simultaneously shared by the two superconductors. The resulting tunneling interaction energy is proportional to the reduced pairing gap, that is ($\Delta_a\Delta_A/(\Delta_a+\Delta_A)$). \idx{Josephson effect!reduced pairing gap}
\section{Rotation in gauge space}\label{S3.7}
The occurrence of rotation as a feature of the nuclear spectrum, e.g. of pairing rotational bands, originates in the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking of rotational invariance in the two dimensional gauge space. In other words, violation of particle number conservation, which introduces a deformation that makes it possible to specify an orientation of the system in gauge space.


The condensate in the nuclear superfluid system involve a deformation of the field that creates the fermion pairs. The process of addition or removal of a Cooper pair constitutes \textit{a rotational mode in gauge space in which particle number plays the role of angular momentum}. Pairing rotational bands represents the collective mode associated with restoration of particle number conservation.
Let us elaborate on the above points within the framework of a simple model which contains the basic physical features one is interested in discussing.


We consider $N$ nucleons moving in a single $j$-shell\footnote{For details see e.g. App. H of \cite{Brink:05} and refs. therein.} of energy $\epsilon_j$ and total angular momentum $(ls)j$. The number of pairs moving in time reversal state which can be accommodated in the shell is $\Omega=(2j+1)/2$. Consequently, the value of the BCS occupation parameters are $V=(N/2\Omega)^{1/2}$ and $U=(1-N/2\Omega)^{1/2}$. The solution of the BCS number and gap equations associated with a pairing force of constant matrix elements $G$ are
  \begin{align}\label{eq3.7.1}
  \lambda=-\frac{G}{2}(\Omega-N),
  \end{align}
  and
  \begin{align}\label{eq3.7.2}
\Delta=\frac{G}{2}\sqrt{N(2\Omega-N)},
  \end{align}
respectively.


The BCS ground state energy of the superfluid system is
  \begin{align}\label{eq3.7.3}
U=2\sum_{\nu>0}(\epsilon_\nu-\lambda)V^2_\nu-\frac{\Delta^2}{G}.
  \end{align}
  The fact that the single-particle energies are measured with respect to $\lambda$ implies that the nucleons feel the Coriolis force ($\hbar\dot{\phi}=\lambda$) associated with rotation in gauge space (Eq. (\ref{eq3.7.11}) below). In other words, the BCS solution is carried out in the intrinsic system of reference $\mathcal K'$.
  
  
  We now calculate the ground-state energy in the laboratory frame $\mathcal K$ (see Fig. \ref{fig0.4.4}), 
 
   \begin{align}\label{eq4.7.4x}
E_0=U+\lambda N=2\sum_{\nu>0}\epsilon_\nu V^2_\nu-\frac{\Delta^2}{G}.
 \end{align} 
 Because all $m$-substates of the single $j$-shell are degenerate $\epsilon_\nu=\epsilon$. Setting, for simplicity, $\epsilon_\nu=0$ the above equation can be written as,
    \begin{align}\label{eq4.7.5x}
 E_0=-G\frac{\Omega}{2}N+\frac{G}{4}N^2. 
 \end{align}
 Assuming $\Omega\gg N$ one obtains from Eq. (\ref{eq3.7.1}) $\lambda\approx-G\Omega/2$, leading to 
     \begin{align}\label{eq4.7.6x}
 E_0=\lambda N+\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mathcal J}N^2,
 \end{align}
 where 
 \begin{align}\label{eq4.7.7x}
 \frac{\hbar^2}{2\mathcal J}=\frac{G}{4},
 \end{align}
$\mathcal J$ being the moment of inertia of the associated pairing rotational band\footnote{See \cite{Bes:66}, \cite{Broglia:00}, and references therein.}.  




\subsection{Phase coherence}\label{C3AppD}
The phase of a wavefunction and the number of nucleons (electrons in condensed matter) are conjugate variables. In other words,  gauge angle and  particle number operators $\hat{\phi}$ and $\hat N$ satisfy the commutation relation,
  \begin{align}\label{eq3.7.8}
\left[\hat{\phi},\hat{N}\right]=i.
    \end{align}
In the particle number representation
  \begin{align}\label{eq3.7.9}
\hat N=-i\partial/\partial \phi,\quad \hat \phi=\phi,
    \end{align}
while
  \begin{align}\label{eq3.7.10}
\hat N=N,\quad \hat\phi=i\partial/\partial N,
    \end{align}
in the gauge angle representation. The time derivative of the gauge angle is given by the equation of motion\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Brink:05} App. I.},
  \begin{align}\label{eq3.7.11}
  \dot{\phi}=\frac{i}{\hbar}\left[H,\phi \right]=\frac{1}{\hbar}\frac{\partial H}{\partial N}=\frac{1}{\hbar}\lambda,
    \end{align}
where $\lambda$ is the chemical potential (Fermi energy).







 Gauge invariance, \idx{Gauge!--invariance}
  i.e. invariance under phase changes, implies number of particle conservation in a similar way that rotational invariance implies angular momentum conservation.

Example: let us introduce the  invariant many-body state\footnote{\cite{Anderson:64b}.},
\begin{align}\label{eq3.7.12}
\ket{\Psi_N}=a_1^\dagger a_2^\dagger\dotsb a_N^\dagger \ket{0},
\end{align}
and rotate it an angle $\phi$ with the help of the operator $\mathcal G(\phi)=e^{-i\hat N\phi}$. In other words, making use of
\begin{align}\label{eq3.7.15}
\mathcal G(\phi)\,a_\nu^\dagger\, \mathcal G^{-1}(\phi)=e^{-i\phi}a_\nu^\dagger=a_\nu'^\dagger,
\end{align}
and as a result of the relation $a_\nu^\dagger=e^{i\phi}a_\nu'^\dagger$, one obtains
\begin{align}\label{eq3.7.13}
\ket{\Psi_N}=e^{iN\phi}\ket{\Psi'_N},
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}\label{eq3.7.14}
\ket{\Psi'_N}=a_1'^\dagger a_2'^\dagger\dotsb a_N'^\dagger\ket{0}.
\end{align}
Thus,
\begin{align}\label{eq3.7.17}
\hat N\ket{\Psi_N}=-i\frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}\ket{\Psi_N}=N\ket{\Psi_N}.
\end{align}
 A phase change for a gauge invariant function is just a trivial operation. Like to rotate a rotational invariant function. Quantum mechanically nothing happens rotating a spherical, symmetry conserving, system (in 3D-, gauge, etc.) space.


The situation is  different in the case of the wavefunction   
\begin{align}\label{eq3.7.7}
\nonumber|BCS(\phi)\rangle_{\mathcal{K}} &=\prod_{\nu>0}\left(U_\nu+V_\nu a_\nu^\dagger a_{\bar \nu}^{\dagger}\right)|0\rangle,\\
\nonumber&=\prod_{\nu>0}\left(U'_\nu+e^{-2i\phi}V'_\nu a^\dagger_\nu a^{\dagger}_{\bar \nu}\right)|0\rangle,\\
\nonumber&=\prod_{\nu>0}\left(U'_\nu+V'_\nu a'^\dagger_\nu a'^{\dagger}_{\bar \nu}\right)|0\rangle,\\
&=|BCS(\phi=0)\rangle_{\mathcal{K'}},
\end{align}
where \idx{BCS!--occupation amplitudes (complex quantities)} 

\begin{align}
U_\nu=|U_\nu|=U'_\nu;\quad V_\nu=e^{-2i\phi}V'_\nu \;(V'_\nu=|V_\nu|).
\end{align}
In fact, \idx{BCS!--(coherent) state}
\begin{align}\label{eq3.7.19}
|BCS(\phi)\rangle_{\mathcal{K}}=\left(\prod_{\nu>0}U_\nu'\right)\sum_{N\text{ even}}\frac{e^{-iN\phi}}{(N/2)!}\left(\sum_{\nu>0}c'_\nu P^\dagger_\nu\right)^{N/2}|0\rangle,
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
c_\nu'=\frac{V_\nu'}{U_\nu'};\quad \quad P^\dagger_\nu=a^\dagger_\nu a^\dagger_{\bar\nu},
\end{align}
is a coherent state (see Eq. (\ref{eq0.1.74})) in particle number which can be written as\footnote{The sum in Eq. (\ref{eq3.7.21}) has non-vanishing amplitudes for all even number of fermions $N(=0,2,4\dots)$ and, equivalently, within BCS condensation for all number of (Cooper) fermion pairs $n(=0,1,2,\dots)$; see Eq. (\ref{eq0.1.74}). Adjusting the parameter $\lambda$ (Eqs. (\ref{eq0.1.70})--(\ref{eq0.1.73})), the distribution of normalized $|f_N|^2(\sum_N |f_N|^2=1)$ values is peaked at the average particle number value $\bar N=2\sum_{\nu>0}V_\nu^2$. As in the grand canonical ensemble, the mean square of this distribution $\delta N_{rms}$ ($=4\sum_{\nu>0}U_\nu^2V_\nu^2=\tfrac{V}{(2\pi)^3}\int d\mathbf k\,4\,U^2_kV^2_k$, i.e. the width at half maximum is proportional to the volume, and thus to the number of particles, i.e. $V\sim \bar N$). That is, $\delta N_{rms}=\langle(N-\bar N)^2\rangle^{1/2}=(\langle N^2\rangle-\bar N^2)^{1/2}\sim\sqrt{V}\sim\sqrt{\bar N}$. Consequently in the thermodynamic limit ($N\to\infty$) particle number fluctuation become large, but the relative (fractional) fluctuation $\delta N/\bar N\sim(\bar N)^{-1/2}$ approaches zero; see \cite{Schrieffer:64,Tinkham:96,DeGennes:66}.},
\begin{align}\label{eq3.7.21}
\ket{BCS(\phi)}_{\mathcal K}=\sum_N f_N(\phi)\ket{\Psi_N}.
\end{align}
Let us now apply the gauge angle operator to it,
\begin{align}
\hat{\phi}\ket{BCS(\phi)}_{\mathcal K}=\hat{\phi}\sum_{N}f_N(\phi)\ket{\Psi_N},
\end{align}
that is,
\begin{align}
i\frac{\partial}{\partial N}f_N(\phi)=\phi f_N(\phi).
\end{align}
Thus,
\begin{align}
f_N(\phi)\sim e^{-iN\phi},
\end{align}
and, making use of Eq. (\ref{eq3.7.13}),
\begin{align}\label{eq4.7.25}
\ket{BCS(\phi)}_{\mathcal K}\sim \sum_{N} e^{-iN\phi}\ket{\Psi_N}=\sum_N \ket{\Psi'_{N}}\sim\ket{BCS(\phi=0)}_{\mathcal K'},
\end{align}
 the state $|BCS(\phi=0)\rangle_{\mathcal{K}'}$ being aligned in gauge space in which it defines a privileged orientation ($z'$) with respect to the laboratory system.


An isolated nucleus will not remain long in this product type state. Due to the term\footnote{Within BCS theory of pairing, there are two parameters which determines spontaneous symmetry breaking in gauge space. The probability amplitude with which a pair state ($\nu\bar{\nu}$) is occupied, and that with which it is empty. Namely, $V_\nu$ and $U_\nu$ respectively. As a consequence, there only two fields $F$ which contribute, through terms of type $FF^\dagger$, to the residual interaction $H_{res}$ acting among quasiparticles, which is neglected in the mean field solution of the pairing Hamiltonian. One which is antisymmetric with respect to the Fermi surface namely ($U^2_\nu-V^2_\nu)$ and which leads to pairing vibrations of the gauge deformed state $\ket{BCS}$. The other one, ($U^2_\nu+V^2_\nu)$ is symmetric with respect to $\epsilon_F$ and leads to fluctuations which diverge in the long wavelength limit ($W''_1\to0$) in precisely the right way to set $\ket{BCS}$ into rotation with a finite inertia, and restore gauge symmetry (see Eq. \ref{eq0.1.93}).}  $(G/4)\left(\sum_{\nu>0}\left(U^2_\nu+V^2_\nu\right)\left(\Gamma_\nu^\dagger-\Gamma_\nu\right)\right)^2$ in the residual quasiparticle Hamiltonian it will fluctuate, and decay into a state
\begin{align}\label{eqbeta}
|N\rangle \sim \int d\phi e^{iN\phi}|BCS(\phi)\rangle_{\mathcal{K}}\sim \sum_{N'}\int_0^{2\pi}d\phi\, e^{-i(N'-N)\phi}\ket{\Psi_{N'}}\sim\ket{\Psi_{N}}
\end{align}
in keeping with the fact that
\begin{align}\label{eq3.7.27}
\int_0^{2\pi}d\phi\, e^{-i(N'-N)\phi}=\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\left.\frac{i}{N'-N}e^{-i(N'-N)\phi}\right|^{2\pi}_0=0\quad (N\neq N'),\\ 
 \\
 2\pi\,\delta(N,N')\quad (N= N').
\end{array} \right.
\end{align}
The state $\ket{N}$ is a member of a pairing rotational band.  \idx{BCS!--projected state (gauge invariance restoration)}

In the example discussed in connection with Fig.  \ref{fig0.4.5}, $\ket{N}$ is one of the ground states of the Sn-isotopes and $N_0=68$. Making use of the fact that $E_R=\left(\hbar^2/2\mathcal I\right)(N-N_0)^2$ and that $\delta N\delta\phi\approx1$, the coherent state (\ref{eq3.7.21}) will decay into one of the states $\ket{N}$, likely the one corresponding to $N=\sum_{\nu>0}2V_\nu^2$, in a time $\hbar/E_R$. The number of  Cooper pairs participating in the nuclear condensate in the case of e.g. $^{120}$Sn is $\alpha'_0\approx5-6$, the number of neutrons being $2\alpha'_0\approx10$. Because $\delta N\sim\sqrt{N}\sim3$ ($\delta\phi\sim0.3$ rad, that is\footnote{$\delta\phi\approx0.3/(\pi/180)\approx0.3/0.017\approx17^\circ$.} $\delta\phi\sim0.3/0.017\approx 17^\circ$), the energy of rotation in gauge space of a state which is defined with an uncertainty of $\delta\phi\approx0.3$ rad is  $E_R\approx0.092$ MeV$\times(3)^2\approx 1$ MeV ($\hbar^2/2\mathcal I\approx G/4\approx 25\text{ MeV}/(4N_0)\approx0.092$ MeV, see Fig. \ref{fig0.4.5}). Consequently $\hbar/E_R\approx10^{-21}$s. 


This is also the case for metallic superconductors. In fact, the state (\ref{eq3.7.7}) even if prepared in isolation will dissipate because there is a term in the energy of the superconductor depending on $N$, namely the electrostatic energy $e^2(N-N_0)^2/2C$, where $C$ is the electrostatic capacity\footnote{The capacity of a sphere is $C=R$, and we use $R=1$cm in the example discussed (see \cite{Anderson:64b}).}. Because the number of overlapping Cooper pairs contributing to superconductivity lying around the Fermi surface\footnote{In the case of Pb, $\xi\approx0.3\times10^4$ \AA, $r_s=1.22$ \AA, $\Delta\approx1.4$ meV and $\epsilon_F\approx9.47$ eV, are the correlations length, the Wigner-Seitz radius, the pairing gap and the Fermi energy respectively. Consequently ($\xi/r_s)^3\times(\Delta/\epsilon_F)\approx10^6$.} is $\alpha'_0\approx10^6$ and thus the associated number of electrons $2\alpha'_0\approx2\times10^6$, $\delta N\sim\sqrt{N}\sim10^3$, one can write $E_{el}=\frac{e^2}{2C}(\delta N)^2\approx\frac{14.4\text{ eV}\times10^{-8}\text{ cm}}{2\times1\text{ cm}}(10^3)^2\approx10^{-7}$ MeV, and $\hbar/E_{el}\approx 10^{-14}$ s.  In this case $\delta\phi\sim10^{-3}$ radians, that is $\delta\phi\sim10^{-3}/0.017\sim0.1^{\circ}$.   


A different situation is found when one considers different parts of the same superconductor. In this case one can define relative variables $n=N_1-N_2$ and $\phi=\phi_1-\phi_2$ and again $n=-i\partial/\partial \phi$ and $\phi=i\partial/\partial n$. Thus, locally there is a superposition of different $n$ states: $\phi$ is fixed so $n$ is uncertain.There is  a dividing line between these two behaviors, perfect phase coherence and negligible coherence, namely the Josephson effect.


Again, the total phase of the assembly is not physical. However, the relative phases can be given a meaning when one observes, as one does in e.g. junctions between metallic superconductors, that pairs of electrons can pass back and forth through the barrier, leading to the possibility of coherence between states in which the total number of electrons is not fixed \emph{locally}. Under such conditions there is, for instance, a coherence between the state with $N/2$ electrons in one of the weak linked superconductors  and $N/2$ in the other, and that with $(N/2)+2$ on one   and $(N/2)-2$ on the other.
\section{Medium polarization effects and pairing}\label{C3AppEx}
In many-body systems, medium polarization effects play an important role in renormalizing single-particle motion and the four-point vertices, namely Coulomb interaction in condensed matter and the bare $NN$-potential in nuclei. In what follows, special attention is paid to this mechanism in connection with the pairing interaction.
\subsection{Nuclei}\label{S4.A.1}
\idx{Induced pairing interaction}
Elementary modes of excitation constitute a basis of states in which correlations, as found in observables, play an important role. As a consequence, it allows for an economic, low dimensionality solution of the nuclear many-body problem of structure and reaction.


As a result of their interweaving,  the variety of elementary modes of excitation may break in a number of states, eventually acquiring a lifetime and, within a coarse grain approximation, a damping width (imaginary component of the self energy). Moving into the continuum, as for example in the case of direct reactions, one such component is the imaginary part of the optical potential\footnote{See footnote \ref{f21c1} Ch. \ref{introduction}.} operating in the particular channel selected. It can, in principle, be calculated microscopically using similar techniques and elements as e.g. those used in the calculation of the damping width of giant resonances or of single-particle states. In this way, the consistency circle structure-reaction based on elementary modes and codified by NFT could be closed. The rich variety of emergent properties found along the way eventually acquiring a conspicuous level of physical validation. At that time it would be possible, arguably if there is one, to posit that the \textit{ultima ratio} of structure and reactions, in any case that associated with pairing and Cooper pair transfer in nuclei, have been unveiled\footnote{In the above paragraph we allowed ourselves to paraphrase Jacques Monod writing in connection with biology and life: L'\textit{ultima ratio} de toutes les structures et performances t\'el\'eonomiques des \^etres vivants est donc enferm\'ee dans les s\'equences des radicaux des fibres polypeptidiques ``embryons'' de ces d\'emons de Maxwell biologiques que sont les prot\'eines globulaires. En un sens, tr\`{e}s r\'{e}el, c'est \`a ce niveau d'organisation chimique qui g\^it, s'il y en a un, le secret de la vie. Et saurait--on non seullement d\'ecrire les s\'equences, mais \'enoncer la loi d'assemblage \`a laquelle ob\'eissent, on pourrait dire que le secret est perc\'e, l'ultima ratio d\'ecouverte (\cite{Monod:70}).}.
\subsubsection{Effective moments}
At the basis of the coupling between elementary modes of excitation, for example of single--particle motion and of collective vibrations, one finds the fact that, in describing the nuclear structure it is necessary to make reference to both of them simultaneously and in an unified way.
   \begin{figure}
   \centerline{\includegraphics*[width=8cm,angle=0	]{nutshell/figs/fig3_A_1}}
   \caption{(a) $F$-moment of a single-particle and (b,c) renormalization effects induced by the collective vibration $\alpha$.}\label{fig3.A.1}
   \end{figure}

Within the harmonic approximation the above statement is economically embodied in e.g. the relation existing between the collective $(\hat \alpha)$ and the single--particle $(\hat F)$ representation of the operator creating e.g. a particle-hole excitation. That is\footnote{cf. \cite{Bohr:75}, cf. also \cite{Brink:05} App. C.}, 
\begin{align}\label{eq1AppE1}
\nonumber \hat F&=\left\{\braket{k|F|\tilde i}\Gamma_{ki}^\dagger+\braket{\tilde i|F|k}\Gamma_{ki}\right\}\\
\nonumber &=\sum_{k,i,\alpha'}X_{ki}^{\alpha'}\Gamma_{\alpha'}^{\dagger}-Y_{ki}^{\alpha'}\Gamma_{\alpha'}\\
\nonumber &=\sum_{\alpha'}\Lambda_{\alpha'}\sum_{ki}\frac{\left|\braket{\tilde i|F|k}\right|^22(\epsilon_i-\epsilon_k)}{(\epsilon_k-\epsilon_i)^2-(\hbar\omega_{\alpha'})^2}\left(\Gamma_{\alpha'}^\dagger+\Gamma_{\alpha'}\right)\\
 &=\sum_{\alpha'}\frac{\Lambda_{\alpha'}}{\kappa}\left(\Gamma_{\alpha'}^{\dagger}+\Gamma_{\alpha'}\right)=\sum_{\alpha'}\sqrt{\frac{\hbar\omega_{\alpha'}}{2C_\alpha'}}\left(\Gamma_{\alpha'}^{\dagger}+\Gamma_{\alpha'}\right)=\hat \alpha.
\end{align}
This is a consequence of the self consistency relation
\begin{align}
\delta U(r)=\int d\mathbf r' \delta \rho(r)v(|\mathbf r{-\mathbf r'}|),
\end{align}
existing between density (collective) and potential (single-particle) distortion, typical of normal modes of many-body systems. It is of notice that the assumption is made that $F$ is dimensionless while $\kappa$ (see Eq. (\ref{eq3AppE1})) has energy dimensions (see e.g. Eqs. (\ref{eq1.0.16}) and (\ref{eq1.2.11})).

Relation (\ref{eq1AppE1}) implies that at the basis of these normal modes one finds the (attractive $\kappa<0$) separable interaction 
\begin{align}\label{eq3AppE1}
H=\frac{\kappa}{2}\hat F^\dagger\hat F,
\end{align}
but where now (Fig. \ref{fig3.A.1} (a))
\begin{align}
\hat F=\sum_{\nu_1,\nu_2} \braket{\nu_1|F|\nu_2}a^\dagger_{\nu_1}a_{\nu_2},
\end{align}
is a general single-particle operator, while $\hat F$ in  Eq. (\ref{eq1AppE1}) is its harmonic representation acting in the particle $(k)$--hole ($i$) space, $\Gamma^\dagger_{ki}$ and $\Gamma_{ki}$ being (quasi) bosons, i.e. respecting the commutation relation 
\begin{align}
\left[\Gamma_{ki},\Gamma^\dagger_{k'i'}\right]=\delta(k,k')\delta(i,i').
\end{align}
In other words, the representation (\ref{eq1AppE1}), which is at the basis of the RPA (as well as QRPA), does not allow for scattering vertices, processes which become operative by rewriting (\ref{eq3AppE1}) in terms of the particle--vibration coupling Hamiltonian
\begin{align}\label{eq3AppE4}
H_c=\kappa\hat \alpha\hat F.
\end{align}
\emph{It is of notice that $\kappa$ is negative for an attractive field}. Let us now calculate the effective single-particle moments (cf. Fig. \ref{fig3.A.1} (b)),
\begin{align}
\nonumber \braket{\nu_2|\hat F|\nu_1}_{(b)}=&\frac{\braket{\nu_2|\hat F|\nu_2,n_\alpha=1}\braket{\nu_2,n_\alpha=1|H_c|\nu_1}}{(\epsilon_{\nu_1}-\epsilon_{\nu_2})-\hbar\omega_\alpha},\\
\nonumber &=\frac{\braket{0|\hat \alpha|n_\alpha=1}\kappa\alpha \braket{\nu_2|F|\nu_1}}{(\epsilon_{\nu_1}-\epsilon_{\nu_2})-\hbar\omega_\alpha},\\
&=\kappa\alpha^2\frac{ \braket{\nu_2|F|\nu_1}}{(\epsilon_{\nu_1}-\epsilon_{\nu_2})-\hbar\omega_\alpha},
\end{align}
and (Fig. \ref{fig3.A.1} (c))\footnote{In calculating the energy denominators one takes the difference between the energy of the initial and of the intermediate states. However, when an external field like $\hat F$ acts on the system, before the PVC or four-point vertices operate, being equivalent to an observation, the energy denominator is to be calculated as the energy difference between the final and the intermediate states. }
\begin{align}\label{eq8App1E}
\nonumber \braket{\nu_2|\hat F|\nu_1}_{(c)}&=\frac{\braket{\nu_2|H_c|\nu_1,n_\alpha=1}\braket{\nu_1,n_\alpha=1| F|\nu_1}}{\epsilon_{\nu_2}-(\epsilon_{\nu_1}+\hbar\omega_\alpha)},\\
&=\kappa\alpha^2\left(-\frac{\braket{\nu_2|F|\nu_1}}{(\epsilon_{\nu_1}-\epsilon_{\nu_2})+\hbar\omega_\alpha}\right),
\end{align}
leading to 
\begin{align}
\nonumber \braket{\nu_2|\hat F|\nu_1}_{(b)}&+\braket{\nu_2|\hat F|\nu_1}_{(c)}=\kappa\alpha^2\frac{2\hbar \omega_\alpha\braket{\nu_2|F|\nu_1}}{(\epsilon_{\nu_1}-\epsilon_{\nu_2})^2-(\hbar\omega_\alpha)^2},\\
&=\frac{\kappa}{C_\alpha}\frac{(\hbar\omega_\alpha)^2\braket{\nu_2|F|\nu_1}}{(\epsilon_{\nu_1}-\epsilon_{\nu_2})^2-(\hbar\omega_\alpha)^2}.
\end{align}
This is in keeping with the fact that the ZPF of the $\alpha$-vibrational mode is,
\begin{align}
\alpha=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar\omega_\alpha}{2C_\alpha}}.
\end{align}
The particle-vibration coupling strength used below is defined as,
\begin{align}
\Lambda_\alpha=\kappa\alpha.
\end{align}
Together with $\braket{\nu_2|\hat F|\nu_1}_{(a)}=\braket{\nu_2|F|\nu_1}$ (see Fig. \ref{fig3.A.1} (a)) one obtains
\begin{align}\label{eq3.A.12}
\braket{\nu_2|\hat F|\nu_1}=\left(1+\chi(\omega)\right)\braket{\nu_2|F|\nu_1},
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}\label{eq3.A.13}
 \chi_\alpha(\omega)=\frac{\kappa}{C_\alpha}\frac{\omega_\alpha^2}{\omega^2-\omega_\alpha^2}
\end{align}
is the polarizability coefficient while
\begin{align}\label{eq3.A.14}
\omega=|\epsilon_{\nu_1}-\epsilon_{\nu_2}|/\hbar.
\end{align}
In the static limit, e.g. in the case in which $\alpha$ is a giant resonance and $\omega_\alpha\gg\omega$ one obtains
\begin{align}\label{eq3.A.15}
\chi_\alpha(0)=-\frac{\kappa}{C_\alpha}.
\end{align}
The sign of $\chi_\alpha(0)$ is opposite to that of $\kappa$, since the static polarization effect produced by an attractive coupling ($\kappa<0$) is in phase with the single--particle moment, while a repulsive coupling ($\kappa>0$) implies opposite phases for the polarization effect and the one--particle moment\footnote{\cite{Bohr:75,Mottelson:62}. Think in the first case about the effect the GQR ($\tau=0$) plays in $(e(E2))_{eff}$, in the second that played by the GDR ($\tau=1$) in $(e(E1))_{eff}$.}.



Let us now calculate the two-body pairing induced interaction (Fig. \ref{fig3.A.2}) arising from the exchange of collective vibrations\footnote{In the present discussion we do not consider spin modes. For details see e.g. \cite{Idini:15}. See also \cite{Bortignon:83}.},  summing over the two time orderings and symmetrizing between initial and final states\footnote{Cf. \cite{Brink:05} p. 217.}
\begin{align}
\nonumber v_{\nu\nu'}^{ind}(a)+v_{\nu\nu'}^{ind}(b)&=\kappa^2\alpha^2\left|\braket{\nu'|F|\nu}\right|^2\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_\nu-\epsilon_{\nu'}-\hbar\omega_\alpha}+\frac{1}{\epsilon_{\nu'}-\epsilon_{\nu}-\hbar\omega_\alpha}\right),\\
\nonumber &=\kappa^2\alpha^2\left|\braket{\nu'|F|\nu}\right|^2\left(\frac{1}{(\epsilon_\nu-\epsilon_{\nu'})-\hbar\omega_\alpha}-\frac{1}{(\epsilon_{\nu}-\epsilon_{\nu'})+\hbar\omega_\alpha}\right),\\
\nonumber &=\Lambda_\alpha^2\left|\braket{\nu'|F|\nu}\right|^2\left(\frac{2\hbar\omega_\alpha}{(\epsilon_\nu-\epsilon_{\nu'})^2-(\hbar\omega_\alpha)^2}\right),\\
&=v_{\nu\nu'}^{ind}(c)+v_{\nu\nu'}^{ind}(d).
\end{align}
   \begin{figure}

   \caption{Diagrams associated with nuclear pairing induced interaction.}\label{fig3.A.2}
   \end{figure}
Thus
\begin{align}\label{eq3.A.17}
\nonumber v_{\nu\nu'}^{ind}&=\frac{1}{2}\left(v_{\nu\nu'}^{ind}(a)+v_{\nu\nu'}^{ind}(b)\right)+\frac{1}{2}\left(v_{\nu\nu'}^{ind}(c)+v_{\nu\nu'}^{ind}(d)\right)\\ &=\Lambda_\alpha^2\left|\braket{\nu'|F|\nu}\right|^2\left(\frac{2\hbar\omega_\alpha}{(\hbar\omega)^2-(\hbar\omega_\alpha)^2}\right). \idx{Induced pairing interaction}
\end{align}
The diagonal matrix element,
\begin{align}
\nonumber v_{\nu\nu}^{ind}\equiv-\frac{2\Lambda_\alpha^2\left|\braket{\nu|F|\nu}\right|^2}{\hbar\omega_\alpha},
\end{align}
testifies to the fact, for values of $\omega_\alpha\gtrsim\omega$, 
 the induced pairing interaction is attractive.
Summing to (\ref{eq3.A.17}) the matrix element of the bare interaction (\ref{eq3AppE1}), (Fig. \ref{fig3_A_3} (b))\footnote{\label{f82C1} Within the framework of (\ref{eq3AppE1}) and of its role in (\ref{eq17App1E}) one finds, in the case of superconductivity in metals to be discussed below,  that the bare unscreened Coulomb interaction can be written as 
	\begin{align*}
	U_c(r)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j}\frac{q_iq_j}{|\mathbf r_i-\mathbf r_j|}, 
	\end{align*}
	$i,j$ running over all particles (nuclei and electrons) and $q_i=-e$ for electrons and $Ze$ for nuclei.}
\begin{align}
v_{\nu\nu'}^{bare}=\kappa\left|\braket{\nu'|F|\nu}\right|^2,
\end{align}
one obtains for the total pairing matrix element\footnote{It is of notice that $\Pi_{\nu\nu'}$ is closely related to Lindhard's function (\cite{Lindhard:53}). See Eq. (\ref{eqC2AppA24}) below.}
\begin{align}\label{eq17App1E}
\nonumber v_{\nu\nu'}&=\kappa\left|\braket{\nu'|F|\nu}\right|^2+\frac{\kappa^2}{C_\alpha}\left|\braket{\nu'|F|\nu}\right|^2\frac{\omega_\alpha^2}{\omega^2-\omega_\alpha^2}=v^{bare}_{\nu\nu'}+\frac{\kappa}{C_\alpha}v^{bare}_{\nu\nu'}\frac{\omega_\alpha^2}{\omega^2-\omega_\alpha^2}\\
&=v_{\nu\nu'}^{bare}\left(1+v_{\nu\nu'}^{bare}\Pi_{\nu\nu'}(\omega,\omega_\alpha)\right). \idx{Induced pairing interaction}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
\Pi_{\nu,\nu'}=\left\{\begin{array}{c}
 \left(C_\alpha\left|\braket{\nu'|F|\nu}\right|^2\right)^{-1}\frac{\omega_\alpha^2}{\omega^2-\omega_\alpha^2},\\ 
\left(D_\alpha\left|\braket{\nu'|F|\nu}\right|^2\right)^{-1}\frac{1}{\omega^2-\omega_\alpha^2},
\end{array}
\right. 
\end{align}
   \begin{figure}
   \centerline{\includegraphics*[width=12cm,angle=0	]{nutshell/figs/fig3_A_3}}
   \caption{Starting with two bare nucleons moving around a closed shell system $N_0$ in Hartree-Fock orbitals (arrowed lines far left), a graphical (NFT) representation of (a) self energy processes and of (b) bare and (c) induced pairing interactions are displayed.}\label{fig3_A_3}
   \end{figure}
both expressions being equivalent in keeping with the fact that $\omega_\alpha=(C_\alpha/D_\alpha)^{1/2}$. In the second expression of $\Pi_{\nu\nu'}$  the inertia of the phonon appears in the denominator, similar to the factor $(Z/AM)$  in (\ref{eqC2AppA24}) below. The units of both $C_\alpha$ and ($\hbar^2/D_\alpha$) are  MeV and, as a consequence, $\hbar\omega_\alpha=(\hbar^2C_\alpha/D_\alpha)^{1/2}$ is also an energy. The units of $\Pi_{\nu\nu'}$ are MeV$^{-1}$ in keeping with the units of  $v^{bare}_{\nu\nu'}$. 

It is of notice that $v_{\nu\nu'}$ can display a resonant behaviour leading to attraction regardless whether $v_{\nu\nu'}^{bare}$ is attractive or repulsive $(\lim_{\omega-\omega_\alpha\to0^-}\Pi_{\nu\nu'}\to-\infty)$, a situation of relevance in the case of dielectric polarization effects in metals (see Sects. \ref{App3A2} and \ref{App3A3}). In that case, the resulting effective electron-electron interaction (phonon exchange) is attractive (see Eq. (\ref{eqC2AppA23})), and  at the basis of Cooper pair correlation and BCS superconductivity.

The importance of having available a bare interaction which allows for the calculation of HF and RPA solutions and thus of renormalized single-particle and of effective interactions on equal footing is apparent from Eq. (\ref{eq17App1E}) (see also the last paragraph of Sect. \ref{App3A3} in connection with pairing in metals).

Let us consider the nucleus $^{11}$Li, in which case Cooper pair binding results mainly from the exchange of the low-lying dipole mode between the two halo nuclei. Making use of the bare screened interaction\footnote{See \cite{Broglia:19b}.} $G_{scr}\approx0.05G\approx0.1$ MeV ($G\approx 28/A$ MeV) ($v_{\nu\nu'}^{bare}=-G_{scr}=-0.1$ MeV), and of the induced pairing interaction $v^{ind}_{\nu\nu'}(=M_{ind}\approx-0.6$ MeV), one can write for the last term in (\ref{eq17App1E}), \mbox{$(0.1$ MeV$)^2\Pi_{\nu\nu'}(\omega_\alpha,\omega)=-0.6$ MeV} leading to $\Pi_{\nu\nu}=-60$ MeV$^{-1}$. This large effect is not a strictly resonant phenomenon, although the energies $\hbar\omega(=\tilde\epsilon_{p_{1/2}}-\tilde\epsilon_{s_{1/2}}\approx0.5$ MeV) and $\hbar\omega_\alpha(\approx0.7$ MeV) are rather similar, in keeping also with the fact that the pygmy dipole resonance\footnote{\cite{Broglia:19}.} PDR has a width of the order of $\Gamma\approx0.5$ MeV.

At the basis of the quite small value of the energy centroid of the $^{11}$Li soft $E1$-mode, one finds the low energy dipole particle-hole excitation between the parity inverted levels (0.45 MeV) and the screened symmetry potential ($V_1=25$ MeV) which arising from the poor overlap between the core ($^9$Li) and the halo neutron wavefunctions, as in the case of $G_{scr}$ can be assumed, for order of magnitude estimates, to be equal to it (i.e. $\approx0.05$). Thus $(V_1)_{scr}\approx1.25$ MeV.


One can compare the parametrization\footnote{Concerning the first expression of $\hbar\omega_{GDR}$ (see \cite{Bohr:75}, Eq (6-27a)) while concerning $C^{(0)}=41A^{-5/3}$ MeV fm$^{-2}$ and $\kappa_1=\frac{V'_1}{4A\langle x^2\rangle}=\frac{5V_1}{AR^2}=3.5V_1A^{-5/3}$ fm$^{-2}$ ($V_1'=130$ MeV; $V_1=V'_1/4=33$ MeV) we refer to Eqs. (6-313) and (6-314).}
\begin{align}\label{eq4.8.21}
\nonumber\hbar\omega_{GDR}&=\hbar\omega_0\left(1+\frac{\kappa_1}{C^{(0)}}\right)^{1/2}=\frac{41\text{ MeV}}{A^{1/3}}\left(1+\frac{3.5 V_1}{41\text{ MeV}}\right)^{1/2}\\
&\approx\frac{80}{A^{1/3}}\text{ MeV}\approx36\text{ MeV}\quad(A=11)
\end{align}
used to estimate the value of the centroid of the giant dipole resonance with Eq. (\ref{eq3.6.23}), rewritten as
\begin{align}\label{eq4.8.22}
\nonumber\hbar\omega_{pygmy}&=0.45\text{ MeV}\left(1+\left(\frac{0.86}{0.45}\right)^2\right)^{1/2}=0.45\text{ MeV}\left(1+\frac{0.6(V_1)_{scr}}{0.2\text{ MeV}}\right)\\
&=1\text{ MeV}.
\end{align}

% One can compare the parametrization\footnote{\cite{Bohr:75} Eq. (6-315a). See also Eq. (6-27) of this reference.} $\hbar\omega_{GDR}=\hbar\omega_0\left(1+\kappa_1/C^{(0)}\right)^{1/2}=41\times A^{-1/3}$ MeV ($1+3.5V_1/(41$ MeV))$^{1/2}\approx41^{-1/3}$ MeV$\times$ ($1+88/41 )^{1/2}\approx41^{-1/3}$ MeV $\times 1.8\approx 73 A^{-1/3}$ MeV, used to describe the centroid of the GDR with Eq. (\ref{eq3.6.23}). That is, $\hbar\omega_{pygmy}\approx0.45$ MeV (1+0.6$(V_1)_{screened}/0.20$ MeV)$^{1/2}\approx0.45$ MeV$\times$(1+0.8/0.2)$^{1/2}\approx0.45$ MeV$\times2.2$. Expression which leads to $\hbar\omega_{pygmy}\approx 1$ MeV while the above one gives, for the GDR of $^{11}$Li to $\hbar\omega_{GDR}\approx 33$ MeV.


Expressed it differently, the screened repulsive symmetry potential can hardly increase the energy of the dipole particle-hole excitation $\tilde\epsilon_{p_{1/2}}-\tilde\epsilon_{s_{1/2}}\approx0.45$ MeV.

Let us now carry out a simple estimate of the contribution of the induced pairing interaction to the (empirical) nuclear pairing gap for nuclei lying along the stability valley. For this purpose we introduce the quantity
 \begin{align}
\lambda=N(0)v_{\nu\nu'}^{ind}
 \end{align}
where $N(0)$ is the density of levels of a single spin orientation at the Fermi energy. The above quantity is known as the nuclear mass enhancement factor. This is because of the role it plays in the nucleon $\omega$--mass (see Sects. \ref{C6AppA} and \ref{C6AppI})
 \begin{align}
m_\omega=(1+\lambda)m.
 \end{align}
Systematic studies of this quantity, and of the related discontinuity displayed by the single-particle occupation number at the Fermi energy, namely $Z_\omega=(m/m_\omega)$ testifies to the fact that $\lambda\approx0.4$, within an energy interval of the order of 10 MeV around the Fermi energy.


The BCS expressions of the pairing gap in terms of $\lambda$ are
\begin{align}\label{eq24App3E}
\Delta=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
2\hbar\omega_De^{-1/\lambda},&\text{(weak coupling } \lambda\ll1)\\ 
\hbar\omega_D\lambda,&(\text{strong coupling }\lambda\geq1)
\end{array}
\right. 
\end{align}
where $\omega_D$ is the limiting frequency of the low-lying collective modes of nuclear excitation, typically of quadrupole and octupole vibrations. 


In keeping with the fact that collective modes, in particular quadrupole vibrations are found at low energies, we choose $\hbar\omega_D\approx5$ MeV which, together with  $\lambda=0.4$, intermediate between weak and strong coupling situations leads to,
\begin{align}
\Delta\approx 0.8\,\text{MeV}
\end{align}
if one uses the first expression (Eq. (\ref{eq24App3E})), and to
\begin{align}
\Delta\approx2.0\,\text{MeV},
\end{align}
if one uses the second. Values to be compared with the empirical value
\begin{align}
\Delta\approx1.4\,\text{MeV},
\end{align}
of superfluid medium heavy mass nuclei like for example in the Sn-isotopes.

While the relations (\ref{eq24App3E}) can hardly be relied to provide a quantitative number, they testify to the fact that induced pairing is expected to play an important role in nuclei. These expectations have been confirmed by detailed confrontation of theory with experiment\footnote{See footnote \ref{f53C3} of Ch. \ref{chapter1}.}.
\subsubsection{Hindsight}
Static polarization effects can be important in dressing single-particle states. For example, effective charges  and induced interactions associated with moments induced by giant resonances\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Bohr:75}, Eqs. (6-217) and (6-228).}. However, retarded $\omega$-dependent self-energy effects and induced interactions associated with low-energy collective modes, are essential in describing structure and reactions of many-body systems. Examples are provided by the bootstrap binding of the halo neutrons (pair addition mode) to $^9$Li, leading to the fragile $\ket{^{11}\text{Li}(gs)}$, displaying a $S_{2n}\approx0.380$ MeV as compared to typical values of $S_{2n}\approx16$ MeV as far as structure goes, and by the $^1$H($^{11}\text{Li},^9\text{Li}(1/2^-;2.69\,\text{MeV}))^3$H population of the lowest member of the ($2^+\times p_{3/2}(\pi))_{J^-}$ multiplet of $^9$Li with a cross section $\sigma(1/2^-$;2.69 MeV)$\approx 1$ mb, as far as reaction goes.
If there was need for support coming from other fields of research, one can mention just two: a) the van der Waals force in e.g. the folding and the associated folding domain size of globular proteins\footnote{It is of notice that similar arguments (see Sect. \ref{App1AF} ) are at the basis of the estimate (\ref{eq2.F.5}) (see also Sect. \ref{C2SG2}) concerning the size of the halo nucleus $^{11}$Li, a quantity which is influenced to a large extent by the maximum distance (correlation length) \idx{Halo (single Cooper pair) nucleus $^{11}$Li!correlation length} over which  partners of a Cooper pair are virtually  but also solidly anchored to each other, and have to be seen as an extended (quasi) bosonic entity. The fact that Cooper pair transfer proceeds mainly in terms of successive transfer controlled by the single-particle mean field, reinforces the above physical picture of nuclear pairing. Even under the effect of an extremely large, as compared to the pair correlation energy, external single-particle fields, namely that of target and projectile, the Cooper pair field extends over the two nuclei, permeating the whole summed nuclear volume also through  small (normal) density overlap.}, b) the electron-phonon interaction in superconductivity.





The overscreening effect which  weakly binds Cooper pairs stems from a delicate $\omega$-dependent interaction which in the case of low temperature superconductors leads, eventually, to one of the first macroscopic manifestations of quantum mechanics, as e.g. ``permanent'' magnetic fields associated with persistent  supercurrents.

The statement ``\textit{Life at the edge of chaos}'' coined in connection with the study of emergent properties in biological molecules reflects the idea,  expressed by de Gennes\footnote{\cite{DeGennes:94}.}, that truly important new properties  emerge in systems lying at the border between rigid order and randomness.  We find physical examples of such systems, in e.g. the marginally stable, single  halo Cooper pair nucleus $^{11}$Li lying at the dripline, and the similarly marginally stable proteins of   viral particles like the HIV-1- and HCV-proteases\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Broglia:13b}.}.


 Let us conclude by quoting again de Gennes but doing so with the hindsight of more than twenty years of nuclear research which have elapsed since ``Les objets fragiles'' was first published. The chapter entitled  ``Savoir s'arreter, savoir changer'' starting at p. 180 opens with the statement ``En ce moment, la physique nucl\'eaire (la science des noyaux atomiques) est une science qui, \`a mon avis, se trouve en fin de parcours\dots C'est une physique qui demande des moyens co\^uteux, et qui s'est constitu\'ee par ailleurs en un puissant lobby. Mais elle me semble naturellement ext\'enu\'ee\dots je suis tent\'e de dire: ``Arretons''\dots mais ce serait aussi absurde que de vouloir arreter un train a grande vitesse. Le mieux serait d'aiguiller ce train sur une autre voie, plus nouvelle et plus utile \`a la collectivit\'e.''


In a way, and even without knowing de Gennes remarks, part of the nuclear physics community have followed them. Capitalizing on the insight that novel embodiments which concepts like elementary modes of excitation, spontaneous symmetry breaking and phase transitions have had in the study of finite quantum many-body systems, of which the nucleus provides a paradigmatic example, one has applied them to other fields of research. In particular to the understanding of protein folding in an attempt to shed light on the possibility of designing leads to  drugs (folding inhibitors) which are less prone to elicit resistance\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Broglia:05,Rosner:17} and refs. therein. Within this connection see also \cite{Bergasa:20} and references therein as well as \cite{Service:20} \cite{reviewservice}\cite{reviewservice},  Jumper 2020 and \cite{Broglia:01b}.} finding  unexpected connections, let alone  the parallels that one has been able to establish and the associated progress resulting from them concerning atomic clusters  and quantum dots physics, a particular example being the discovery of super shells\footnote{\cite{Pedersen:91,deHeer:87,Brack:93,Pacheco:91,Lipparini:03,Martin:94,Bjornholm:94}.}.







\subsection{Metals}\label{App3A2}
\subsubsection{Plasmons and phonons (jellium model)}
The expression of the electron plasmon (\textbf{ep}) frequency of the antenna-like oscillations of the free, conduction electrons of mass $m_e$ and charge $-e$, against the positive charged background (jellium model)\footnote{Model in which the positive charge of the lattice ions is assumed to be uniformly distributed throughout the solid.} is
\begin{equation}\label{eq3.A.33}
\omega_{ep}^2=\frac{4\pi n_e e^2}{m_e}=\frac{3e^2}{m_er_s^3},
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
n_e=\frac{3}{4\pi}\frac{1}{r_s^3},
\end{equation}
are the number of electrons per unit volume\footnote{In the nuclear case one can write $\rho_n=1/(4\pi r_0^3/3)=0.14$ fm$^{-3}$ ($r_0=1.2$ fm), to be compared with the saturation density $\rho_0=0.17$ fm$^{-3}$.}, $r_s$ being
\begin{equation}
r_s=\left(\frac{3}{4\pi n_e}\right)^{1/3},
\end{equation}
that is, the radius of the Wigner-Seitz cell.


For\footnote{cf. page 5, table 1.1 of \cite{Ashcroft:87}.} metallic Li
\begin{equation}
n_e=4.70\frac{10^{22}}{\text{cm}^3}=\frac{4.7\times10^{-2}}{\text{\AA{}}^3},
\end{equation}
while
\begin{equation}
r_s=\left(\frac{3\text{\AA}^3}{4\pi\times4.7\times10^{-2}}\right)^{1/3}=1.72\text{\AA},
\end{equation}
implying a value $(r_s/a_0)=3.25$ in units of  Bohr radius $(a_0=0.529$\AA).
Making use of 
\begin{equation}
\alpha=7.2973\times10^{-3}=\frac{e^2}{\hbar c}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
e^2=14.4\,\text{eV \AA},
\end{equation}
one obtains
\begin{equation}
\hbar c=\frac{14.4\,\text{eV \AA}}{7.2973\times10^{-3}}=1973.3\,\text{eV \AA}.
\end{equation}
With the help of the above values and of
\begin{equation}
m_ec^2=0.511\,\text{MeV},
\end{equation}
one can write
\begin{equation}
\hbar^2\omega^2_{ep}=\frac{(\hbar c)^2}{m_e c^2}\frac{3e^2}{r_s^3}=\frac{(1973.3\,\text{eV \AA})}{0.511\times10^6\,\text{eV}}\frac{3\times14.4\,\text{eV \AA}}{(1.72\,\text{\AA})^3}=64.7\,\text{eV}^2
\end{equation}
leading to\footnote{\cite{Kittel:96} Table 2, p. 278.}
\begin{equation}
\hbar\omega_{ep}=8.04\,\text{eV}\approx 1.94\times 10^9\,\text{MHz}
\end{equation}


For the case of metal clusters of Li, the Mie resonance frequency is\footnote{See \cite{Bertsch:05}, Sect. 5.1, also Table 5.1.}
\begin{equation}
\hbar\omega_M=\frac{\hbar\omega_{ep}}{\sqrt{3}}=4.6\,\text{eV}.
\end{equation}
\subsection{Elementary theory of phonon dispersion relation}\label{App3A3}
Within the framework of the jellium model, one can estimate the long wavelength ionic plasma (\textbf{ip}) frequency introducing in (\ref{eq3.A.33})  the substitution $e\rightarrow Ze$, $m_e\rightarrow AM$ ($A=N+Z$, mass number, $M$ nucleon mass), $n_e\rightarrow n_i=n_e/Z$,
\begin{equation}\label{eqC2AppA2}
\omega_{ip}^2=\frac{4\pi n_i(Ze)^2}{AM}=\frac{Zm_e}{AM}\omega_{ep}^2,
\end{equation}
$AM (Ze)$ being the mass (charge) of the ions\footnote{\cite{Ketterson:99}, p. 230.}.
For metallic Li, one obtains
\begin{align}
\nonumber\hbar\omega_{ip}&=\left(\frac{Zm_e}{AM}\right)^{1/2}\hbar\omega_{ep}=\left(\frac{3\times0.5}{9\times10^3}\right)^{1/2}\times1.94\times 10^{15}\,\text{sec}^{-1}\\
&\approx2.5\times10^{13}\,\text{sec}^{-1}\approx10^{13}\,\text{sec}^{-1}\approx1.04\times10^2\,\text{meV}.
\end{align}
Now, both  the  relations (\ref{eq3.A.33}) and (\ref{eqC2AppA2}), although being quite useful, are wrong from a many-body point of view: $\omega_{ep}$ because electrons appear as bare electrons not dressed by the phonons, neither by the plasmons; $\omega_{ip}$ because the  static negative background does not allow for an exchange of electron plasmons between ions, exchange eventually leading to a screened, short-range ionic Coulomb repulsive field. Namely ions interact, in the approximation used above, in terms of the ``bare'' ion--ion Coulomb interaction. Being it infinite range it does not allow for a dispersion relation linear in $k$ at long wavelengths (sound waves) but forces a finite ``mass'' also to the lattice phonons. Allowing for electron screening of the ``bare'' ion-ion Coulomb interaction, as embodied in the Thomas-Fermi electron gas dielectric function $1/\epsilon_{TF}=q^2/(q^2+k_s^2)$, one obtains the \textit{dressed phonon frequency}
\begin{equation}\label{eqC2AppA3}
\omega_q^2=\frac{\omega_{ip}^2}{\epsilon_{TF}}=\frac{Zm_e}{AM}\frac{\omega_{ep}^2}{q^2+k_s^2}q^2=\frac{\omega_{ip}^2}{q^2+k_s^2}q^2.
\end{equation}
The quantity
\begin{equation}\label{eq3.A.43}

\end{equation}
is the Thomas-Fermi screening wave vector, a quantity which is of the order of the Fermi momentum, the associated screening length being then of the order of the Wigner-Seitz radius. In writing the above relations use has been made of
\begin{equation}\label{eq3.A.44b}
k_F=\left(\frac{9\pi}{4}\right)^{1/3}\frac{1}{r_s}=\frac{1.92}{r_s},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eq3.A.44}
\epsilon_F=\frac{e^2a_0}{2}k_F^2=\frac{50.1}{(r_s/a_0)^2}.
\end{equation}
 In the case of metallic Li ($k_F=1.12$ \AA$^{-1}$, $r_s=1.72$ \AA),
\begin{equation}\label{eq3.A.45}
k_s=1.64\text{ \AA}^{-1}.
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eq4.8.46}
\epsilon_F=4.74\text{ eV}\quad(r_s/a_0=3.25).
\end{equation}
 Let us return to (\ref{eqC2AppA3}), and take the long wavelength limit of $\omega_q$. One finds
\begin{equation}\label{eq3.A.46}
\lim_{q\to0}\omega_q=c_sq
\end{equation}
 the sound velocity (squared) being 
\begin{equation}\label{eqC2AppA8}
c_s^2=\frac{Zm_e}{AM}\frac{4\pi n_ee^2}{m_e}\frac{\epsilon_F}{6\pi n_e e^2}=\frac{2Z}{3 AM}\epsilon_F=\frac{Zm_e}{3 AM}v_F^2,
\end{equation}
With the help of (\ref{eq3.A.44b}), of the velocity of light and of the proton mass,
\begin{equation}\label{eqC2AppA10}
c=3\times 10^{10}\,\text{cm/sec};\quad Mc^2=938.87\text{ MeV},
\end{equation}
one obtains,
\begin{align}\label{eqC2AppA11}
\nonumber v_F=\left(\frac{\hbar}{m_e}\right)k_F&
=\left(\frac{\hbar c}{m_e c^2}\right)\times 3\times 10^{10}\frac{\text{cm}}{\text{sec}}\frac{1.92}{r_s}\\
&=\left(\frac{1973.3\,\text{\AA eV}}{0.511\times 10^6\,\text{eV}}\right)\times 3\times 10^{10}\frac{\text{cm}}{\text{sec}}\frac{1.92}{1.72\text{ \AA}}
\approx 1.29\times 10^8 \frac{\text{cm}}{\text{sec}},
\end{align}
and,
\begin{equation}\label{eqC2AppA12}
c_s^2=\frac{1}{3}\frac{3m_e}{9M}v_F^2\approx 6\times 10^{-5}v_F^2,
\end{equation}
that is,
\begin{equation}\label{eqC2AppA13}
c_s\approx 7.8\times 10^{-3}v_F\approx 1.0\times 10^6 \frac{\text{cm}}{\text{sec}},
\end{equation}
approximately equal to a hundredth of the Fermi velocity\footnote{\cite{Ashcroft:87}, p. 51, \cite{Ketterson:99} p. 234.}.



Let us now discuss the effective electron-electron interaction. Within the jellium model used above one can write it as
\begin{equation}\label{eqC2AppA14}
V(\mathbf q,\omega)=\frac{U_c(q)}{\epsilon(\mathbf q,\omega)},
\end{equation}
where the dielectric function
\begin{equation}\label{eqC2AppA15}
\frac{1}{\epsilon(\mathbf q,\omega)}=\frac{\omega^2q^2}{\omega^2(q^2+k_s^2)-\omega^2_{ip}q^2}
\end{equation}
contains the effects due to both the ions and the background electrons, while
\begin{equation}\label{eqC2AppA16}
U_c(q)=\frac{4\pi e^2}{q^2}
\end{equation}
is the Fourier transform of the bare Coulomb interaction\footnote{The units being [$U_c(r)]=$ eV, [$U_c(q)]=$ eV$\times$ \AA$^3$.}
\begin{equation}\label{eqC2AppA17}
U_c(r)=\frac{e^2}{r}.
\end{equation}
For $\omega\gg \omega_{ip}$, $\epsilon(\mathbf q,\omega)^{-1}=q^2/(q^2+k_s^2)=\epsilon_{TF}^{-1}$, and  one obtains the  screened Coulomb field,
\begin{equation}\label{eqC2AppA18}
U_c^{scr}(q)=\frac{U_c(q)}{\epsilon_{TF}(q)}=\frac{4\pi e^2}{q^2+k_s^2}.
\end{equation}
Its $\mathbf r$ space Fourier transform is 
\begin{equation}\label{eqC2AppA19}
U_c^{scr}(r)=\frac{e^2}{r}e^{-k_s r}.
\end{equation}
A quantity that for large values of $r$ falls off exponentially. Thus, in the high frequency limit, the electron--electron interaction, although strongly renormalized by the exchange of plasmons, as testified by the fact that (e.g. for Li),
\begin{equation}\label{eqC2AppA20}
U_c^{scr}(r=5\,\text{\AA})\approx U_c(r=5\,\text{\AA})e^{-1.6\times 5}\approx \,1\text{meV},
\end{equation}
as compared to $U_c(r=5\,\text{\AA})\approx 2.9$ eV, is still repulsive.


Let us now consider frequencies $\omega\ll \omega_{ip}$ but for values of $q$ of the order of $a^{-1}$, where $a$ is the lattice constant ($a\approx 3-5$\AA, $a^{-1}\approx 0.25$\AA$^{-1}$) to be compared to $k_s\approx 1.6 $\AA$^{-1}$ and $k_F\approx 1.12$\AA$^{-1}$ (metallic Li). In the case in which $\omega_{ip}^2/\omega^2>(q^2+k_s^2)/q^2$, $V$ is attractive (see Eqs. (\ref{eqC2AppA14}) and (\ref{eqC2AppA15})).  This behavior explicitly involves the ions through $\omega_{ip}$ (electron-phonon coupling). 


The dispersion relation of the associated frequency collective modes follows from
\begin{equation}\label{eqC2AppA21}
\epsilon(\mathbf q,\omega)=0.
\end{equation}
In other words, making use of Eq. (\ref{eqC2AppA15}) one obtains the relation (\ref{eqC2AppA3}). One can now rewrite the reciprocal of the dielectric functions in terms of $\omega_{q}$, that is,
\begin{align}\label{eqC2AppA22}
\nonumber \frac{1}{\epsilon(\mathbf q,\omega)}&=\frac{\omega^2q^2}{\omega^2(q^2+k_s^2)-\omega_{ip}^2q^2}=\frac{q^2}{(q^2+k_s^2)}\frac{\omega^2}{(\omega^2-\omega_q^2)}\\
&=\frac{q^2}{q^2+k_s^2}\left[1+\frac{\omega_q^2}{\omega^2-\omega_q^2}\right].
\end{align}
For $\omega\gg \omega_q$ one recovers the Thomas-Fermi dielectric function. For $\omega$ near, but smaller than $\omega_q$ the interaction (\ref{eqC2AppA14}) eventually becomes   attractive\footnote{\cite{Schrieffer:64}, Fig. 6--11, p. 152.}. The effective electron-electron interaction can be  written as
\begin{align}\label{eqC2AppA23}
\nonumber V(\mathbf q,\omega)&=\frac{4\pi  e^2}{q^2+k_s^2}+\frac{4\pi  e^2}{q^2+k_s^2}\frac{\omega_q^2}{\omega^2-\omega_q^2}\\
\nonumber &=U^{scr}_c(q)+U_c^{scr}(q)\frac{\omega_q^2}{\omega^2-\omega_q^2}\\
&=U^{scr}_c(q)\left(1+U^{scr}_c(q)\Pi(\mathbf q,\omega)\right), \idx{Induced pairing interaction!parallel with pairing in superconductors}
\end{align}
where\footnote{It is of notice that $\omega_q^2=\left(Zm_e/AM\right)\omega^2_{ep}\times q^2/(q^2+k_s^2)=(Z/AM)\,4\pi e^2 n_e q^2 /(q^2+k_s^2)=U^{scr}_c(q)\times(Z/AM)n_e q^2$ where the relations (\ref{eqC2AppA3}) and (\ref{eq3.A.33}) have been used.}
\begin{align}\label{eqC2AppA24}
\Pi(\mathbf q,\omega)=\left(\frac{Z}{AM}\right)\frac{n_e q^2}{\omega^2-\omega_q^2}.
\end{align}
The units of $\Pi(\mathbf q,\omega)$ are eV$^{-1}$\AA$^{-3}$, in keeping with those of $U_c^{scr}(q)$.


In working out the last expression Eqs. (\ref{eqC2AppA3}) and (\ref{eq3.A.33}) have been used. In other words $\omega_q^2=(Zm_e/AM)(\omega^2_{ep}/(q^2+k_s^2))q^2=(Z/AM)(4\pi n_ee^2/(q^2+k_s^2))q^2$.
It is of notice the close relation of (\ref{eqC2AppA23}) with the expression (\ref{eq17App1E}) of the nuclear renormalized pairing interaction. The first term of $V(\mathbf q,\omega)$ contains the screened Coulomb field arising ultimately from the exchange of plasmons between electrons (see Fig. \ref{fig3.A.4})\footnote{Within this context one can, apparently, note an important difference. Namely the fact that in the nuclear case $v^{bare}$ appears, while in the case of condensed matter $U_c^{scr}$ instead of $U_c$ is present (see also footnote \ref{f82C1} of this Chapter). This is because in the nuclear case, it is not standard praxis to explicitly indicate the renormalization associated with the exchange (nor the emission and absorption by the same nucleon) of giant resonances (see Fig. \ref{fig3.A.4}). Nonetheless, the corresponding effects are taken into account e.g. in the $\gamma$-decay of neutron states (effective charge).}. The second term with the exchange of collective low frequency phonons calculated making use of the same screened interaction\footnote{\cite{Lindhard:53}.}.  


Concerning the parallels discussed above between pairing in nuclei and in metals, it is also important to point  out the important differences. At least concerning the possibility of developing a unified theoretical working tool. 

In metals, the bare interaction emerges from the exchange of photons, a process which can be described at profit in terms of an instantaneous Coulomb interaction. While major progress have been made concerning the bare nucleon interaction at large, and the $NN$-pairing interaction in particular, taking also into account three-body processes and carrying out ab initio calculations\footnote{See footnote \ref{f9} Ch. \ref{introduction}.}, we are not yet in possess of the equivalent to the Coulomb interaction.  Let alone of a so called low-$k$ version of such interaction, which could allow to work out on equal footing Hartree-Fock-Boguliubov solutions, and QRPA microscopic calculations of low-lying collective modes in a variety of channels (density, spin, charge-exchange, etc.).

Concerning these phonons, they are built out of the same nucleon degrees of freedom which already exhaust the nuclear phase space. Double counting and Pauli principle violations have to be taken care of in using the collective modes as intermediate bosons. In metals, phonons are associated with lattice vibrations, that is degrees of freedom different from the electronic ones.


On the other hand, in nuclei one can describe in terms of individual quantal states and of single Cooper pairs, if not identical, rather similar phenomena as those leading to some of the most remarkable and technically transferable quantum phenomena. In particular, the Josephson effect. This fact makes the nuclear pairing paradigm a unique laboratory of low-temperature (finite) many-body physics.

   \end{figure}



We conclude this section with a technical remark. Making use of (\ref{eqC2AppA23})we calculate the mass enhancement factor\footnote{It is assumed that in this calculation we have multiplied (\ref{eqC2AppA23}) by $n_e$, as well as shifted the corresponding factor appearing in $\Pi(\mathbf q, \omega)$ to $U_c^{scr}(q)$. Schematically, it is assumed $n_eV=(n_e U_c^{scr})\left(1+(n_e U_c^{scr})\left(\frac{Z}{AM}\right)\frac{q^2}{\omega^2-\omega_q^2}\right)$.}
\begin{align}\label{eqC2AppA25}
\lambda=N(0)V(\mathbf q,\omega)=N(0)U^{scr}_c\left(1+U^{scr}_c\Pi\right).
\end{align}
In the weak coupling limit $(\lambda^2\ll\lambda)$
\begin{align}\label{eqC2AppA26}
\Delta=2\omega_De^{-1/\lambda},
\end{align}
where $\omega_D$ is the Debye energy.
  Provided that one considers  a situation in which $\omega$ is consistently different from $\omega_q$,
\begin{align}\label{eqC2AppA28}
\frac{1}{\lambda}=\frac{1}{N(0)U^{scr}_c\left(1+U^{scr}_c\Pi\right)}\approx\frac{1}{N(0)U^{scr}_c}\left(1-U^{scr}_c\Pi\right),
\end{align}
Thus
\begin{align}\label{eqC2AppA29}
\frac{1}{\lambda}=\frac{1}{N(0)U^{scr}_c}-\frac{\Pi}{N(0)},
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}\label{eqC2AppA30}
\Delta=\left(2\omega_De^{\frac{\Pi}{N(0)}}\right)e^{-\frac{1}{N(0)U^{scr}_c}}.
\end{align}
\idx{BCS!self consistency between mean field and pairing gap renormalization} Consequently, the renormalization effects of the pairing gap associated with phonon exchange are independent of the approximation used to calculate $U^{scr}_c$ (Thomas-Fermi in the above discussion), provided one has used the same ``bare'' (screened) Coulomb interaction to calculate $\omega^2_q$.   Otherwise, the error introduced through a resonant renormalization process entering the expression of e.g. the pairing gap, could be consistent.
\subsection{Pairing condensation (correlation) energy}
\idx{BCS!pairing condensation (correlation energy)}
The condensation energy, namely the energy difference $W_N-W_S$ between the normal $N$-- and superfluid $S$--state is defined as (Eq. (2-35) of ref\footnote{\label{foot1}\cite{Schrieffer:64}.})
\begin{align}\label{eqC3AppA1}
W_{con}=W_N-W_S=\frac{1}{2}N(0)\Delta_0^2,
\end{align}
where $N(0)$ is the density of single-electron states of one-spin orientation evaluated at the Fermi surface, and $\Delta_0$ is the pairing gap at $T=0$.


The correlation energy $E_{corr}$ introduced in equation (6-618) of \footnote{\cite{Bohr:75}.}
\begin{align}\label{eqC3AppA2}
E_{corr}=-\frac{1}{2d}\Delta^2
\end{align}
to represent $W_S-W_N$ in the nuclear case, was calculated making use of a (single particle) spectrum of two--fold degenerate (Kramer degeneracy) equally spaced (spacing $d$) single--particle levels. Consequently, $2/d$ corresponds to the total level density, and $1/d=N(0)$. In keeping with the fact that a nucleus in the ground state (or in any single quantal state), is at zero temperature, Eq. (\ref{eqC3AppA2})  coincides with (\ref{eqC3AppA1}), taking into account the difference in sign in the definitions.

\end{table}
The empirical value of the level density parameter for both states $(\nu,\bar \nu)$ (Kramers degeneracy, both spin orientations) is $a\approx A/10$ MeV$^{-1}, A=N+Z$ being the mass number. Thus, for neutrons one can write $a_N\approx N/10$ and $N_N(0)\approx N/20$ MeV$^{-1}$. For $^{120}_{50}$Sn$_{70}$, $N_N(0)\approx 4$ MeV$^{-1}$. Because $\Delta=1.46$ MeV, (Table \ref{Tab3.A.1})
\begin{align}\label{eqC3AppA3}
W_{con}=\frac{1}{2}\times 4\text{ MeV}^{-1}\times (1.46)^2\text{ MeV}^2\approx 4\text{ MeV}.
\end{align}
The binding energy per nucleon is $BE/A=8.504$ MeV. Thus $BE=120\times 8.504\text{ MeV}=1.02\times10^{3}$ MeV, and
\begin{align}\label{eqC3AppA4}
\frac{W_{con}}{BE}\approx 4\times10^{-3}.
\end{align}
\subsubsection{Superconducting lead}
Making use of the value\footnote{\cite{Beck:70}.}
\begin{align}\label{eqC3AppA5}
N(0)=\frac{0.276\text{ eV}^{-1}}{\text{atom}},
\end{align}
and of $\Delta_0=1.4$ meV, one obtains
\begin{align}\label{eqC3AppA6}
W_{con}=0.27\times10^{-6}\text{eV/atom}.
\end{align}
In keeping with the fact that the cohesive energy of lead, namely the energy required to break all the bonds associated with one of its atoms is
\begin{align}\label{eqC3AppA7}
E_{cohe}=2.03\frac{\text{eV}}{{atom}},
\end{align}
one obtains
\begin{align}\label{eqC3AppA8}
\frac{W_{con}}{E_{cohe}}\approx1.3\times10^{-7}.
\end{align}
The different quantities are summarized in Table \ref{Tab3.A.1}.
\section{Cooper pair: radial dependence}\label{App3B}
\idx{Cooper pair!--radial dependence}

  \begin{figure}
  	\centerline{\includegraphics*[width=15cm,angle=0	]{nutshell/figs/Fig3B1}}
  	\caption{Aspects of the halo Cooper pair of the nucleus $^{11}$Li.}\label{fig3B1}
  \end{figure}
The wavefunction of a Cooper pair  can be written as
\begin{align}\label{eq3B1}
\Psi(\mathbf r_1\sigma_1;\mathbf r_2\sigma_1)=\phi_q(\mathbf r)e^{i\mathbf q\cdot\mathbf R}\chi(\sigma_1,\sigma_2)
\end{align}
where $\mathbf R=(\mathbf r_1+\mathbf r_2)/2$, $\mathbf r=\mathbf r_1-\mathbf r_2$, and $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ denote the spins\footnote{In the limit $q\rightarrow 0$ the relative coordinate problem is spherically symmetric so that $\phi_0(\mathbf r)$ is an eigenfunction of the angular momentum operator (\cite{Schrieffer:64}).}. 


Let us consider the state with zero center of mass momentum ($q=0$) and with zero spin, so that the two electrons carry  equal and opposite momenta, aside of being in the singlet spin state state, with
\begin{align}\label{eq3B2}
\chi=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[
\left(\begin{array}{c}
1\\ 
0
\end{array} \right)
\left(\begin{array}{c}
0\\ 
1
\end{array} \right)-
\left(\begin{array}{c}
0\\ 
1
\end{array} \right)
\left(\begin{array}{c}
1\\ 
0
\end{array} \right)
\right].
\end{align}
 We have thus a pair of electrons moving in time reversal states and can write\footnote{In other words, one expands the $l=0$ wavefunction $\phi_0$ in terms of $s$--states of relative momentum $k$ and total momentum zero.},
\begin{align}\label{eq3B3}
\phi_0(\mathbf r)=\sum_{k>k_F}g(\mathbf k)e^{i\mathbf k\cdot\mathbf r}=\sum_{k>k_F}g(\mathbf k)e^{i\mathbf k\cdot\mathbf r_1}\,e^{-i\mathbf k\cdot\mathbf r_2}.
\end{align}
In the above wavefunction Pauli principle $(k>k_F)$ and translational invariance (dependence on the relative coordinate $\mathbf r$) are apparent. 
Within this scenario, and in keeping with the fact that $|v^{eff}_p|/\epsilon_F\ll1$, where $v_p^{eff}=v^{bare}_p+v^{ind}_p$,  $\phi_0(\mathbf r)$ \textit{consists mainly of waves of wavenumber $k_F$}. Because the wavefunction of a Cooper pair represents a bound $s$-state, the motion it describes is a periodic back and forth movement of the two electrons in  directions which are uniformly distributed, covering a relative distance $\approx\xi$, as schematically\footnote{\cite{Weisskopf:81}.} shown in Fig. \ref{fig3B1} (\textbf{i}). It is analogous to the motion of the two nucleons in a deuteron or the main ($L=0$) component of the two neutrons in the triton. The hydrogen atom in $s$-state is also an example; in that case it is the electron that does most of the back and forth moving, whereas the proton only recoils slightly.

In keeping with the above arguments, $\phi_0(\mathbf r)$ will look like $e^{i\mathbf k_F\cdot \mathbf r}$ for $r\ll\xi$, while for $r\gg \xi$ the waves $e^{i\mathbf k\cdot \mathbf r}$
weighted by $g(\mathbf k)$ will destroy themselves by interference   (Fig. \ref{fig3B2}). In other words, $\phi_0(\mathbf r)$ will look like $e^{i\mathbf k_F\cdot \mathbf r}$ for $r\ll\xi$ while for $r\gtrsim\xi$ one can approximate the weighting function as,
\begin{align}\label{eq3B7}
g(\mathbf k)\sim\delta(\mathbf k,\mathbf k_F+i\mathbf{\hat k}_F/\xi),
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{\hat k}_F$ is a unit vector. One then obtains (see also Eq. (\ref{eq4.3.2})),
\begin{align}\label{eq3B8}
\phi_0(\mathbf r)\sim e^{-r/\xi}e^{ik_Fr}.
\end{align}
Because we are dealing with a singlet state, and the total wavefunction has to be antisymmetric,
\begin{align}\label{eq3B9}
\phi_0(\mathbf r)\sim e^{-r/\xi}\cos k_Fr,
\end{align}
 A more proper solution of the Cooper pair problem leads to\footnote{\cite{Kadin:07}; see also \cite{VanWitsen:14}.}
\begin{align}\label{eq3B10}
\phi_0(\mathbf r)\sim K_0(r/\pi\xi)\cos k_Fr,
\end{align}
where $K_0$ is the zeroth-order modified Bessel function. For $x\gg 0$, $K_0(x)\sim (\pi/2x)^{1/2}\exp(-x)$, where $x=r/\pi\xi$.

A wavefunction which extends over distances much larger than the range of the binding potential is a well-known phenomenon when the binding energy is small. For example,  in the case of the deuteron mentioned above.  Be as it may, in the case of metallic superconductors the large size of the Cooper pair wavefunction also explains why the electrostatic repulsion between electron partners does not appreciably influence the binding. 

Going back to Fig. \ref{fig3B1}, it is illustrative to elaborate on the two (NFT calculated) situations displayed in (\textbf{b}) and (\textbf{e}), concerning the relative distribution of the halo neutrons of $^{11}$Li. Pairing correlations being, in particular in this case, mainly a surface phenomenon bring, for $r_1=7.5$ fm, the two nucleons close to each other as compared to the uncorrelated situation (diagram (\textbf{g})\footnote{Shown for $r_1=6$fm. No qualitative difference is expected for $r_1=7.5$fm in this uncorrelated configuration.}). The fact that this result, which is not under discussion, is more subtle than just expressed, emerges by looking at (\textbf{h}), where the situations displayed in (b) and (e) (see also (a) and (d)), are schematically drawn in a single plot corresponding to: \textbf{I}) the (``free from external fields'') BCS-like, Cooper pair  (dashed curve) which implies that the two neutrons recede from each other; II) the (``actual''), confined, situation in which the average potential $U(r)=\int  d\mathbf r' \rho(\mathbf r')v(|\mathbf r-\mathbf r'|)$, acts as a strong external field. It determines where normal ($\rho(r)$), and thus abnormal densities can find themselves, thus distorting the halo Cooper pair. It leads to the situation represented with the continuous (solid) line. That is, a situation in which the two halo neutrons have come closer to each other as compared to the uncorrelated configuration\footnote{And to do so, the finite quantal system under discussion uses the mechanism discussed in Sect. \ref{app3D} namely, spatial quantization.}. 


In principle, both situations can be experimentally observed. That labelled II) in terms of high energy electron scattering or $(p,pn)$ reactions\footnote{\cite{Kubota:20}.}, while that labelled I),  making use of a two-particle pick up reaction, e.g. ($^1$H($^{11}$Li,$^9$Li)$^3$H). In fact, during the period of time the proton is around the grazing distance, and one of the halo neutrons joins it to form a virtual deuteron, the other neutron can be at the antipodes, essentially one diameter apart. The situation will essentially evolve into the density distribution represented with the dashed curve in (h), the two members of the halo Cooper pair being at a distance of the order of the correlation length \idx{Halo (single Cooper pair) nucleus $^{11}$Li!correlation length} and carrying a much lower relative momentum than that typical of the situation (e) (continuous irregular curve). It is then natural that successive transfer dominates the absolute differential cross section.

While it is true that both I) and II) can be the outcome of experiments, the specific probe of dynamic or static distortion in gauge space, and thus of Cooper pair structure is Cooper pair transfer.



\subsubsection{Specific probe}
\idx{Two-nucleon transfer!specific probe}
From daily life experience one can state that, as a rule, macroscopic, condensed systems find themselves in the presence of external fields which fix the \textit{order parameter} at some definite preferred value. Because of the long-range order, a very weak external field can pin down the \textit{orientation} (violation of rotational invariance) and \textit{position} (violation of translational invariance) of a crystal, or of a chair\footnote{Quoting from \cite{Weinberg:96b} Ch. 19: ``\dots spontaneous symmetry breaking actually occurs only for idealized systems that are infinitely large. The appearance of broken symmetry for a chair arises because it has a macroscopic moment of inertia $\mathcal I$, so that its ground state is part of a tower of rotationally excited states whose energies are separated by only tiny amounts, of the order of $\hbar^2/\mathcal I$\dots even very weak\dots rotationally asymmetric external fields will cause any\dots state of the chair with definite angular momentum rapidly to develop components with other angular momentum quantum numbers. States of the chair that are relatively stable\dots are\dots those with a definite orientation, in which the rotational symmetry of the underlying theory is broken''. In connection with superconductivity, distortion in gauge space is measured by the number of Cooper pairs  \idx{BCS!--order parameter (number of Cooper pairs)} $\alpha'_0(\approx10^6)$ \idx{Cooper pair!number of}
	 moving close to the Fermi energy, the associated number of electrons taking the place of angular momentum in 3-D space. Now, is it $2\times10^6$ an infinitely large number of particles? And if yes, what about 12--16 nucleons ($\alpha'_0\approx6$--8 for Sn-isotopes)? An answer which can hardly be other than positive, in keeping with the observation of well defined pairing rotational bands, populated in two-nucleon transfer reactions. But if this is so, implying ``angular momentum'' fluctuations as large as $\approx30$\%, why 2 nucleons ($\alpha_0'=1$, $^{11}$Li) with associated fluctuations of $\approx70$\% can not display, in an incipient fashion, basic features of BCS pairing?}.  To determine the value of these order parameter values, one needs to have instruments, probes, experimental setups, or whatever one likes to call them, which violate themselves rotational and translational invariance. Again, daily life objects (instruments) do so.


In the case of superconductivity, the order parameter is $\alpha_0$, $\alpha_0'$ being its magnitude and $\phi$ its phase. It is gauge invariance which is spontaneously violated, the (BCS) superconductor displaying a rather perfect internal gauge phase order. There are not many instruments which have such a property but another superconductor acting as a probe, weakly coupled\footnote{\idx{Linear response} Linear response. See footnote \ref{f1C2} Ch. \ref{intro}.} to the probed superconductor. Said it differently, a Josephson junction and associated special effects. In particular direct currents of carriers of charge $2e$ and mass $2m_e$.


Returning to the nuclear scenario, pair transfer, eventually back and forth\footnote{\cite{Potel:20b,r}.} pair transfer, of nucleons correlated in time reversal states over distances $\xi$, is the specific probe of pairing in atomic nuclei in general, and of halo nuclear Cooper pairs in particular.

 To interact at profit through long wavelength medium polarization pairing, pairs of nucleons have to have low momentum. To do so they have to reduce the effect of the strong external (mean) field by moving away from it, possible mechanisms being among others: halo (Fig. \ref{fig3B1}), transfer processes (see e.g. Fig. \ref{fig_1}; see also Fig. \ref{fig7.3.1}), exotic decay\footnote{In Fig. \ref{fig3B3x}, a parallel is made between correlation lengths associated with (pairing) particle-particle or hole-hole modes and particle--hole vibrations. These last modes  also display a consistent spatial correlation (see e.g. \cite{Broglia:71}).} (Fig. \ref{fig3B3x}; see also Fig. \ref{fig1.0.2}) and, if nothing else, some amount of spill out.
\subsubsection{Caption Fig \ref{fig3B1}}
         Synthesis of the spatial structure of $^{11}$Li neutron halo Cooper pair calculated in NFT (\cite{Barranco:01}). We use, for illustrative purposes $\xi_{eff}=7.5$ fm, as an \textit{effective Cooper pair mean square radius}\footnote{In connection with this figure we have estimated the Fermi momentum associated with the two halo neutrons of $^{11}$Li as $k_F=(3\pi^2\times2/((4\pi/3)(4.6)^3-(2.5)^3))^{1/3}$ fm$^{-1}$ $\approx0.56$ fm$^{-1}$, the denominator being the volume associated with the halo. Thus $(v_F/c)\approx0.2(k_F)_{\text{fm}^{-1}}\approx 0.1$ and $\xi=\hbar v_F/(\pi\times0.5\text{ MeV})\approx 14$ fm (see also Eq.

(\ref{eq3.2.24})--(\ref{eq3.2.27})); see also footnotes \ref{f17C4} and \ref{f18C4} of this Chapter, as well as Eq. (\ref{eq5App3E}).

\subsection{Number of overlapping pairs}
 

The correlation length for low temperature superconductors is of the order of $10^4$\AA. In the case of e.g. bulk Pb, for which\footnote{\label{foot75}  The experimental value of the critical temperature and of the pairing gap for Pb is $T_c=7.193$ K $(k_BT_c=0.62$ meV) and $\Delta_0(0)=1.5$ meV respectively.  Then  $\Delta_0(0)/k_BT_c=2.26$, to be compared with the BCS prediction of 1.76. Within this context, Pb is considered a strong-coupling superconductor (see \cite{Tinkham:96}, Fig. 2-1).} $\Delta=1.4$ meV and $v_F=1.83\times10^8$ cm/s one has $\xi\approx0.3\times10^{-4}$ cm. 

Since electrons in metals typically occupy a volume of the order of ($1\times$\AA$)^3$ (Wigner-Seitz cell radius), there would be of the order of\footnote{\cite{Ketterson:99} p. 198.} $\xi^3/(\text{\AA})^3\approx 3\times10^{10}$ other Cooper pairs within a ``coherence volume''. Eliminating the electrons deep within the Fermi sea as they behave essentially as if the metal was in the normal phase\footnote{The BCS ground state at $T=0$ consists in two classes of electrons: those deep inside the Fermi sea, which behave essentially in the same way as those in the normal state, and those near the Fermi surface, which form the overlapping Cooper pairs. The latter electrons cannot scatter because they are in a coherent state, their intrinsic motion being frozen because of the pairing gap. The former electrons  cannot either because  blocked by Pauli principle. At $T=0$, all electrons of both classes contribute to the lossless supercurrent (see Sects. 2.2 and 9.4 of \cite{Waldram:96}).}, one gets\footnote{\cite{Schrieffer:64} p. 43.  That is $3\times10^{10}\times(\Delta/\epsilon_F)\approx3\times10^{10}\times\,(1.4\text{ meV}/9.47\text{ eV})\approx 4\times 10^{6}$.} $\approx$10$^6$. \textit{In other words, about a million of other Cooper pairs have their center of mass falling inside the coherence volume of a pair}. Thus, the isolated pair picture (Fig. \ref{fig1A4}) is not correct, but yes that displayed in Fig. \ref{fig1A5}.





 


 In the nuclear case, the number of Cooper pairs participating in the condensate, namely  \idx{BCS!--order parameter (number of Cooper pairs)}
 \begin{align}\label{eq3B11}
\alpha'_0=\braket{BCS|P'^\dagger|BCS}=\sum_j\frac{2j+1}{2}U'_jV'_j, \idx{Cooper pair!number of}
 \end{align}
 can be estimated  with the help of the single $j$-shell model, in which case $V_j=(N/2\Omega)^{1/2}$ and $U_j=(1-N/2\Omega)^{1/2}$, where $\Omega=(2j+1)/2$. For a half-filled shell ($N=\Omega$),  $\alpha'_0=\Omega/2$. With the help of the approximate expression\footnote{Making use of the harmonic oscillator, one can write $\Omega=\frac{1}{2}(N+1)(N+2)\sim A^{2/3}$, where the proportionality constant has a value between 1/2 and 2/3.} $\Omega\approx(2/3)A^{2/3}$ one obtains, for $^{120}$Sn ($N=70$), $\alpha_0'\approx6$--8.
 
 
 
 
 In keeping with the fact that $\xi>R_0$, in the nuclear case one has a complete overlap between all Cooper pairs participating in the condensate. This, together with the fact that the nuclear Cooper pairs press against the nuclear surface in an attempt to expand and are forced to bounce elastically off from  it, receive  circumstantial evidence from the following experimental results:
 
  \textbf{1}) while the moment of inertia of rotational bands\footnote{\cite{Bohr:75} p. 75.} is $\mathcal J_r/2$ it is also $5 \mathcal J_{irrot}$. In other words, while pairing in nuclei is important, its role is only partially exhausted, and certainly strongly distorted by the mean field; 
  
  \textbf{2}) One- and two-nucleon transfer reactions in pairing correlated nuclei have the same order of magnitude. \idx{Josephson effect!parallel with tunneling among members of pairing rotational bands}
   For example $\sigma (^{120}\text{Sn}(p,d)^{119}\text{Sn}(5/2^+; 1.09 \text{ MeV}))=5.35 $mb $(2^\circ<\theta_{cm}<55^\circ)$, while $\sigma (^{120}\text{Sn}(p,t)^{118}\text{Sn}(gs))=2.25 $mb $(7.6^\circ<\theta_{cm}<59.7^\circ)$ (see also footnote \ref{f28} of  Ch. \ref{chapter1}). Furthermore, in the Josephson-like junction, transiently established in the heavy ion collision $^{116}$Sn+$^{60}$Ni at bombarding energies around, but still few MeV below the Coulomb barrier ($\tau_{coll}\approx10^{-21}$ s), one finds for distances of closest approach $D_0\lesssim\xi\approx13.5$ fm, that $\sigma_{2n}$ is of the order of $\sigma_{1n}$. However, while the Cooper pair channel $^{116}$Sn+$^{60}$Ni$\to^{114}$Sn+$^{62}$Ni is dominated by the ground-ground state transition, the single-particle transfer one is inclusive. In fact, the theoretical calculations\footnote{\cite{Montanari:14,Potel:20b}.} of the differential cross section  associated with the channel $^{116}$Sn+$^{60}$Ni$\to^{115}$Sn+$^{61}$Ni indicates the incoherent contribution of a number of quasiparticle states of $^{61}$Ni lying at energies $\lesssim2.64$ MeV. A value which is consistent with twice the pairing gap of Ni. In other words, we are in presence of superconducting-quasiparticle (S-Q) tunneling across the junction, as discussed in connection with Eq. (\ref{eq4.7.20}) (see also Sect. \ref{S7.3}).
  
  
   \textbf{3}) The decay constant of the exotic decay $^{223}_{88}$Ra$_{135}\rightarrow^{14}_6$C$_8+^{209}_{82}$Pb$_{127}$ has been measured to be $\lambda_{exp}=4.3\times10^{-16}$sec$^{-1}$. For theoretical purposes it can be written as $\lambda=PfT$, product of the formation probability $P$ of $^{14}$C in $^{223}$Ra (saddle configuration, see Fig. \ref{fig1.0.2} (e)--(g) and bottom of Fig. \ref{fig3B3x}), the knocking rate $f$ and the tunneling probability $T$. These two last quantities hardly depend on pairing. On the other hand $P$ changes\footnote{See \cite{Brink:05} Ch. 7 and refs. therein.} from $\approx 2\times10^{-76}$ to $2.3\times10^{-10}$ by introducing pairing and, consequently, the associated lifetimes from $10^{75}$y to the ``observed'' (empirical) value of $10^8$y  allowing Cooper pairs to be correlated over distances which can be as large as 20 fm.
 
 
 Within the above context, exotic halo nuclei open new possibilities to understand the physics at the basis of pairing in nuclei. In fact, one may be able to include in a bare $^1S_0$ $NN$-potential the $\approx$50\% contribution associated with the induced pairing interaction to the pairing gap in $^{120}$Sn. Hardly, essentially all of the binding energy ($S_{2n}\approx380$ keV) of the neutron halo Cooper pair of $^{11}$Li to the core $^{9}$Li. At the basis of the large magnitude of renormalization effects of elementary modes of excitation and of medium polarization contributions to the pairing interaction observed in light exotic halo nuclei like e.g. $^{11}$Li,one finds a fundamental parameter of NFT, namely the effective degeneracy $\Omega(\approx2/3A^{2/3})$ of the single-particle phase space, $1/\Omega$ being the small expansion parameter. In the case of $^{11}$Li, $\Omega$ is rather small $(\approx3)$ as compared with heavy nuclei like e.g. $^{210}$Pb $(\Omega\approx24)$. Furthermore, in the case of $^{11}$Li, the surface ($S$) to volume $(V)$ ratio ($=aS/V$, $a$ being the nuclear diffusivity) is much larger\footnote{In carrying out this estimate use was made of $a_{eff}=\left(R(^{11}\text{Li})/R_0(^{11}\text{Li})\right)a$ (within this context see Fig. \ref{fig3.2.2}).} ($\approx0.72$) than in the case of heavy nuclei lying along the stability valley ($\approx0.27$ in the case of $^{210}$Pb).
 \subsection{Coherence length and quantality parameter for $(ph)$ vibrations}\label{App4.B.2}
 \idx{Generalized quantality parameter!parallel between $\beta=0,\pm2$ modes}
As schematically indicated in Fig. \ref{fig1.2.2}, both $\beta=0$ and $\beta=\pm2$ modes contribute to give rise to a sigmoidal shape to the single-particle occupation probabilities within an energy range $\delta\epsilon=|E_{corr}|$ around the Fermi energy. Concerning $\beta=0$ see also Fig. \ref{fig1.2.5}. Consequently, the arguments used in Sect. \ref{S3.4.1} and leading to 
\begin{align}\label{eq3.B.12}
 \xi=\frac{\hbar v_F}{\pi|E_{corr}|}, \idx{Cooper pair!--mean square radius (correlation length)}
 \end{align}
 for pairing modes and resulting in $\xi=\hbar v_F/\pi\Delta$
 for the case of superfluid nuclei, can be used equally well in connection with $\beta=0$ modes. In other words, in a similar way in which pair addition and substraction modes (Cooper pairs) can be viewed as correlated $pp$ and $hh$ modes over distances of the order $\xi$, $\beta=0$ collective vibrations can be pictured as $ph$ modes correlated again over distances inversely proportional to the correlation energy of e.g. the RPA collective roots. Summing up, $\xi$ describes, both in the case of $\beta=\pm2$ and $\beta=0$ modes, a similar  physical property of the vibration: the  length over which  pairs of fermions $((ph),(pp),(hh)$)  are correlated in normal and in superfluid nuclei\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Barranco:19b} and refs. therein.} (see Fig. \ref{fig3B3x}). 
       \begin{figure}
       	\centerline{\includegraphics*[width=13cm,angle=0]{nutshell/figs/fig3B3x}}
       	\caption{\idx{Generalized quantality parameter!parallel between $\beta=0,\pm2$ modes}}\label{fig3B3x} 
       \end{figure}
         \subsubsection{Parallel between $\beta=\pm2$ and $\beta=0$ modes}
         \idx{Generalized quantality parameter!parallel between $\beta=0,\pm2$ modes}
         Vibrations can be classified by the transfer quantum number $\beta$ (see Fig. \ref{fig3B3x}). Collective modes with $\beta=0$ correspond to correlated particle-hole ($ph$) excitations. For example low-lying quadrupole or octupole (surface)  vibrations. Modes with  $\beta=\pm2$  correspond to correlated ($pp$) or $(hh)$ modes, that is, pair addition and pair substraction modes.
         Thinking of these modes propagating in uniform nuclear matter, the associated correlation length can be calculated making use of Eq. (\ref{eq3.B.12}), the correlation energy being, as a rule estimated from the energy shift of the lowest root of the RPA solution for both, $ph$ and pairing modes, from the lowest unperturbed configuration (pole). The (generalized) quantality parameter, ratio of the quantal kinetic energy of localization and the correlation energy,  gives a measure of the tendency to independent particle $(q_\xi\approx1)$ or independent $pp$, $hh$, $ph$ $(q_\xi\ll1)$ motion. A concrete example which testifies to the fact that $(ph)$ excitations (large amplitude surface distortion) and phase correlated independent pair motion (superfluidity) are correlated over dimensions larger than typical nuclear dimensions, is provided by e.g. fission and exotic decay, in particular $^{223}$Ra$\rightarrow^{14}$C$+^{209}$Pb. In the related estimates use has been made of\footnote{\cite{Bohr:69}.} $\Delta=12/\sqrt{A}$ MeV; $C=18.1$ MeV, $D/\hbar^2=29.1$ MeV$^{-1}$ and\footnote{\cite{Brink:05} Sect. 7.1.} $\hbar\omega=\hbar(C/D)^{1/2}\approx0.8$ MeV; $E=2\Delta$ (uncorrelated 2-$qp$ states), $E_{corr}=-(E-\hbar\omega)$. In keeping with the uncertainties affecting the above simple estimates (factor 2 or $\pi$ in the denominator of $\xi,\braket{r^2}^{1/2}_{Cooper}$,  $\sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}\braket{r^2}^{1/2}_{Cooper}$, etc.), it seems fair to conclude that $15\text{ fm}\lesssim\xi\lesssim20\text{ fm}$. Thus, one is likely faced with a  situation in which $2\lesssim\xi/R\lesssim3.$

    \end{table}

 The parallel which can be traced between Cooper pairs and correlated particle-hole excitations is further supported by the fact that two-nucleon transfer reaction do excite quite strongly also the $\beta=0$ modes (see Tables \ref{Tab3.B.1} and \ref{Tab3.B.2}). 
Such parallel  emerged already in the analysis\footnote{\cite{Broglia:67}.} of the $^{206}$Pb$(t,p)^{208}$Pb which provided the experimental confirmation of the theoretical predictions concerning pairing vibrations. In particular concerning the population of the pair addition vibration $\ket{a}\equiv\ket{gs(^{210}\text{Pb})}$ of the two-phonon pairing vibrational mode $\ket{a}\otimes\ket{r}$ (see Fig. \ref{fig1.1} (b)).  Predicted at an excitation energy\footnote{See Fig. 5 of \cite{Bes:66}.} of 4.9 MeV (Figs. \ref{fig1E1} and \ref{fig0.3.2}) in $^{208}$Pb, it was observed\footnote{\cite{Bjerregaard:66b}.} at 4.87 MeV. Because the lowest excited state populated with a sizable cross section (21$\pm3\%$) of that associated with the ground state transition (and thus annihilating the pair removal mode ($\ket{r}\equiv\ket{gs(^{206}\text{Pb})}$), see Fig. \ref{fig1.1}(b) transition denoted r) was observed at $E_x=2.619$ MeV, much effort and time was dedicated to experimentally disentangle an alleged $J^\pi=0^+$ essentially degenerated with the octupole vibration at $E_x=2.62\pm0.01$ MeV.  This was in keeping with the idea that around close shell nuclei, only pairing vibrations were strongly populated, this not being the case for $\beta=0$ collective surface states. 

The analysis of the data dispelled such believe, as testified already by the title of the paper reporting the results. In fact, collective $\beta=0$ and $\beta=\pm2$ are similarly strongly populated in two-nucleon transfer reactions, the main difference being the fact that while the $Y$-components (ground state correlations, see Table  \ref{tab1E3}) contribute in the case of the pairing modes constructively coherent to the cross section, the similar components of the $\beta=0$ modes give rise to destructive interference. Again an example of the competition for phase space between pairing and (dynamical) surface deformation (see e.g. Fig. \ref{figintroF2})\footnote{But more important, a further example of the fact that two-nucleon transfer reaction is the specific tool to probe pairing vibrational modes. In fact, setting $\hbar\omega(\beta=0)=0$ as well as $\hbar\omega(\beta=2)=\hbar\omega(\beta=-2)=0$, in which case the $(X,Y)$-RPA amplitudes of the corresponding modes become equal, the two-nucleon absolute cross section associated with the $\beta=0$ mode vanish, while that of the $\beta=\pm2$ diverge.}. These results originally found in Pb, were confirmed in other mass regions and for different $\beta=0$ modes\footnote{\cite{Broglia:71}.}. 


Within the above scenario one can look forward to the test of the $^9$Li$(t,p)^{11}$Li predictions, concerning the population of both the ground state and the PDR ($E_x\lesssim1$ MeV; see Fig. \ref{fig3.8.1}). Also to assess to which extent the $0^{*+}$ $^{12}$Be excited state and $1^-$ excitation on top of it, can be viewed as related elementary mode of excitation (see Fig. \ref{fig3.8.1}).
 \subsection{Tunneling probabilities}\label{App4.B.3}
 The state $ \ket{BCS(\phi)}_{\mathcal K}=\prod_{\nu>0}(U'_\nu+V'_\nu e^{-2i\phi} a_\nu^\dagger a_{\bar{\nu}}^\dagger)\ket{0}$  displays off-diagonal-long-range-order (ODLRO) \textit{because each pair is in a state $(U'_\nu+V'_\nu e^{-2i\phi} a_\nu^\dagger a_{\bar{\nu}}^\dagger)\ket{0}$ with the same phase as all the others}. In fact, the above wavefunction  leads to a two-particle density matrix with the property $\lim_{\mathbf r_1, \mathbf r_2;\mathbf r_3, \mathbf r_4\rightarrow\infty}\phi(\mathbf r_1, \mathbf r_2;\mathbf r_3, \mathbf r_4)\neq 0$ under the assumption that $r_{12}, r_{34}<\xi, (\mathbf r_1, \mathbf r_2)$ and $(\mathbf r_3, \mathbf r_4)$ being the coordinates of a Cooper pair, $r_{ij}$ the  modulus of the  relative distance between the corresponding partner fermions, and $\xi$ the coherence length\footnote{See footnote \ref{f37c1} of Ch. \ref{introduction}. See also \cite{Ambegaokar:69}, and \cite{Potel:17} and refs. therein.}. Quoting from \cite{Anderson:96}: ``ODLRO \idx{Off-diagonal-long-range-order (ODLRO)}
  is the idea that the density matrix contains a factorizable part $\rho(x,x')=f^*(x)f(x')+$remainder, with the factorizable part playing the role of a condensate wavefunction''.
 
 
 
Bringing the above argument into reaction implies,  $P_2\approx P_1$ \idx{Josephson effect!transfer (tunneling) probability} (see Eq. (\ref{eq3.2.19})).
 The importance of this result  concerning the mechanism at the basis of Cooper pair transfer is connected with the fact that the probability of one-electron tunneling across a typical dioxide layer giving rise to a weak $S-S$ coupling\footnote{\cite{Pippard:12}.} is likely quite small, e.g.  of the order of $10^{-10}$. Consequently, simultaneous pair transfer between two superconductors $(S)$, with a probability  $(10^{-10})^2$ would not be observed\footnote{See e.g. \cite{McDonald:01}.}. Thus, the observed Josephson current of carriers of charge $2e$ results from the tunneling of one Cooper pair partner at a time, equally pairing correlated than when they are both in the same superconductor $(S)$ than when each of them is, within a correlation length,  in a different (of the two weakly coupled) $S$. 

\textit{There is experimental evidence which testifies to the fact that through the Josephson-like junctions, transiently established in heavy ion collisions between superfluid nuclei at energies below the Coulomb barrier, one- and two-nucleon transfer processes display cross sections of the same order of magnitude, provided the distance of closest approach is\footnote{\cite{Potel:20b}.} $D_0\lesssim\xi$.  More correctly Cooper pair transfer cross section, dominated by ground-ground state transition (i.e. exclusive transitions between members of the corresponding pairing rotational bands), are approximately equal to the incoherent contribution of single quasiparticle states up to an energy of about the Cooper pair binding energy ($\approx2\Delta$) \idx{Cooper pair!binding energy}. In other words, the parallel of the equality, within a factor ($\pi/4$) of the maximum Josephson current of an unbiased junction, and the normal (quasiparticle) single electron carrier current across a Josephson junction biased with the equivalent potential ($2\Delta/e$) needed to  break Cooper pairs (see Eq. (\ref{eq4.7.20}) and Fig. \ref{fig4.6.1}).} 
\subsection{Correlation energy revisited}\label{App3B4}
\idx{BCS!pairing condensation (correlation energy)}
The pair-correlation energy is the difference between the energy with and without pairing. The energy including pair correlations is\footnote{See Eq. (\ref{eq0.1.73}).} 
 \begin{align}\label{eq3B17}
E_p=2\sum_{\nu>0}|V_\nu|^2\epsilon_\nu-G\,|\alpha_0|^2,
 \end{align} 
 while the energy without correlation is
  \begin{align}\label{eq3B18}
  E_0=\sum_{\nu>0}|V^0_\nu|^2\epsilon_\nu.
  \end{align} 
 The occupation probabilities $|V^0_\nu|$ are unity below the Fermi energy level and zero above. In both Eqs. (\ref{eq3B17}) and (\ref{eq3B18}) the Fermi energy has to be chosen to give the correct number of particles. The pairing correlation energy is 
   \begin{align}\label{eq3B19}
E_{corr}=E_S-G\,|\alpha_0|^2,
   \end{align} 
 where
   \begin{align}\label{eq3B20}
E_S=\sum_{\nu>0}2(|V_\nu|^2-|V^0_\nu|^2)\,\epsilon_\nu.
   \end{align}  
 The  pairing energy $-G|\alpha_0|^2$ contribution is partially canceled by the first term describing the fact that, in the BCS ground state, particles moving in levels close to the Fermi energy are partially excited across the Fermi surface. That is, $V_\nu^2$ changes smoothly from 1 to 0 around $\epsilon_F$, being 1/2 at the Fermi energy.
 
 
 
 
 In other words, the energy gain resulting from the potential energy term, where $G$ is the pairing coupling constant while $|\alpha_0|$ measures the number of Cooper pairs, is partially compensated by a quantal, zero point fluctuation like term. It can, in principle, be related to the Cooper pair kinetic energy of confinement $T_\xi=\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{1}{\xi^2}$ (already discussed in connection with the generalized quantality parameter (Sect. \ref{App1D})), through the relation $2|\alpha_0|T_\xi$ (for one type of nucleons). Let us make a simple estimate which  provides an embodiment  of the above argument. Consider the nucleus $^{223}$Ra and the associated parameters $G\approx(22/A)$ MeV,     \idx{Condensation energy (confinement and correlation)} $\;|\alpha_0|\approx 5$ and\footnote{This is in keeping with the number of protons and of neutrons outside closed shells. For the estimate of $\xi=\hbar c\times0.27/(\pi\Delta)$ we have used $\Delta=12/\sqrt{A}$ MeV $\approx1$ MeV.} $\xi\approx 17$ fm. Thus,  $T_\xi\approx 0.1$ MeV and $\;2\times(2\times|\alpha_0|\times T_\xi)=2$ MeV, while $\;2\times (-G|\alpha_0|^2)=-5$ MeV is the pairing contribution\footnote{This quantity, but divided by 2, i.e. -2.5 MeV can be compared with the effective pairing matrix element $v=\left(\frac{\Delta_\pi^2+\Delta_\nu^2}{4G}\approx -2.9 \text{ MeV}\right)$, operative at level crossing in the calculation of the inertia of the exotic decay $^{223}$Ra$\rightarrow^{14}$Ca+$^{209}$Pb, cf. \cite{Brink:05} p.159 and refs. therein.} (factor of 2, both protons and neutrons). The resulting pairing correlation energy thus being $E_{corr}=-3$ MeV. This number can be compared with a ``realistic'' estimate provided by the relation\footnote{See e.g. Sect. 3.5 of \cite{Brink:05}.}
   \begin{align}\label{eq3B21}
E_{corr}=-\frac{g\Delta^2}{4},
   \end{align}  
 where $g_n\approx N/10$ MeV$^{-1}$ and $g_p\approx Z/10$ MeV$^{-1}$ (see \cite{Bortignon:98} Eq. (5.2)). Taking into account both types of particles $g=g_n+g_p=A/10$ MeV$^{-1}$ and making use of $\Delta=12/\sqrt{A}$ MeV, one obtains $E_{corr}=-\frac{144}{40}$ MeV $\approx$-3.6 MeV. With the help of $E_{corr}$ and $T_\xi$, one can estimate the generalized quantality parameter, $q_\xi=T_\xi/|E_{corr}|=0.1/3.6\approx 0.03$, as well as make a consistency check  on the value of $\xi$ used, namely $\hbar v_F/|E_{corr}|\approx 15$ fm.
 
\section[Absolute Cooper pair tunneling cross section]{Absolute Cooper pair tunneling cross section: quantitative novel physics at the edge between stability and chaos}\label{App3C}
In the study of many-body systems, in particular of finite quantum many-body systems (FQMBS) like the atomic nucleus, much can be learned from symmetries.  However it is the texture of the associated emergent properties, concrete embodiment of spontaneously symmetry breaking (potential energy) and of its restoration (zero point fluctuations (collective modes), confinement kinetic energy), which provides insight into the eventual new physics. In fact, when one understands the many-body under study in terms of the detailed motion of single-particles (nucleons) and collective motion, taking properly into account their couplings, is that one  may eventually reach a  quantitative understanding of the problem and of its solutions. Furthermore, that these solutions are likely transferable, at profit, to the study of other FQMBS like e.g. metal clusters, fullerenes\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Gunnarsson:04}, \cite{Broglia:04b} and refs. therein.}, quantum dots\footnote{\cite{Lipparini:03}.}, and eventually soft matter, e.g.  proteins\footnote{\cite{Broglia:13b}.}, let alone the fact that one can make predictions. Predictions which, in connection with the study of halo nuclei, in particular of pairing\footnote{Cf. e.g. \cite{Broglia:13}.} involve  novel physics\footnote{Cf. e.g. \cite{Barranco:01,Tanihata:08,Potel:10} and references therein.}.



 Within this context one can quote from Leon Cooper's contribution to the volume\footnote{\cite{Cooper:11}.} BCS: 50 years: ``It has become fashionable\dots to assert\dots that once gauge symmetry is broken the properties of superconductors follow\dots with no need to inquire into the mechanism by which the symmetry is broken\footnote{Quoting (\cite{Weinberg:11}): ``\dots In consequence of this spontaneous symmetry breaking, products of any even number of electron fields have non-vanishing expectation values in a superconductor, though a single electron field does not. All of the dramatic exact properties of superconductors --zero electric resistance, the expelling of the magnetic fields from superconductors known as the Meissner effect, the quantization of magnetic flux through a thick superconducting ring, and the Josephson formula for the frequency of the ac current at a junction between two superconductors with different voltages-- follow from the assumption that electromagnetic gauge invariance is broken in this way, with no need to inquire into the mechanism by which the symmetry is broken.'' The above quotation is similar to saying that once the idea of a double DNA helix was thought, all about inheritance was solved and known, (cf. e.g. \cite{Stent:80} and references therein).}. This is not \dots true, since broken gauge symmetry might led to molecule-like and a Bose-Einstein rather than BCS condensation\dots in 1957\dots the major problem was to show\dots how\dots an order parameter or condensation in momentum space could come about\dots to show how\dots gauge-invariant symmetry of the Lagrangian could be spontaneously broken due to interactions which were themselves gauge invariant''.


Nuclear physics has brought this quest a step further. This time in connection with the ``extension'' of the study of BCS condensation to its origin, a single Cooper pair in the rarified atmosphere resulting from the large radial (isotropic) deformation observed in light exotic, halo nuclei in general, and in $^{11}$Li in particular. During the last few years, the probing of this system in terms of absolute two-nucleon transfer (pick--up) reactions, has helped at making this field a quantitative one, errors below the \%10 limit being the rule. This achievement which has its basis on much experimental work, in particular the  experiments of \cite{Tanihata:08}, is also the result of the combined effort made in treating the structure and reaction aspects of the subject, two sides of the same physics, on equal footing. 
\subsection{Saturation density, spill out and halo}\label{S4.10.1}
In the incipit to the Section on bulk properties of nuclei of Bohr and Mottelson \citep{Bohr:69} p. 139. one reads: ``The almost constant density of nuclear matter is associated with the finite range of nuclear forces; the range of the forces is $r_0$ (where $r_0$ enters the nuclear radius in the expression $R=r_0A^{1/3}$) thus small compared to nuclear size. This ``saturation'' of nuclear matter is also reflected in the fact that the total binding energy of the nucleus is roughly proportional to $A$. In a minor way, these features are modified by surface effects and long--range Coulomb forces acting between the protons''.



Electron scattering experiments (see the figure 2-1, p. 159 of the above reference) yield
\begin{align}
\rho(0)=0.17\,\text{fm}^{-3}.
\end{align}
Thus, one can posit that
\begin{align}
\frac{4\pi}{3}R_0^3\rho(0)=A,
\end{align}
leading to
\begin{align}\label{eq3App3E}
r_0=\left(\frac{3}{4\pi}\frac{1}{\rho(0)}\right)^{1/3}\approx 1.12\,\text{fm}.
\end{align}
Because the above relations imply a step function distribution, one should correct Eq. (\ref{eq3App3E}) by the nucleon spill out\footnote{\cite{Bertsch:05}.}. The relative correction being of the order of $(a_0/R_0)\ln 2\approx (0.65/5.92)\ln 2\approx 0.08\, (A=120)$) associated with the fact that a more realistic distribution is provided by a Fermi function of diffusivity $a_0\approx 0.65$ fm. That is, an 8\% correction leading to $r_0=(1.12+0.08)$ fm $\approx 1.2$ fm. 


In the case of the nucleus $^{11}$Li, observations\footnote{\cite{Kobayashi:89}.} indicate a mean square (gyration radius\footnote{The radius of gyration $R_g$ is a measure of an object of arbitrary shape, $R^2_g$ being the second moment in 3D space. In the case of a sphere of radius $R$, $R^2_g=3R^2/5$.}) $\langle r^2\rangle^{1/2}=3.55\pm 0.1$ fm. Thus
\begin{align}\label{eq4App3E}
R(^{11}\text{Li})=\sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}\langle r^2\rangle^{1/2}\approx 4.58\pm 0.13\,\text{fm}.
\end{align}
Making use of the relation $R_0\approx1.2 A^{1/3}$ fm, the quantity (\ref{eq4App3E}) leads to $(4.58/1.2)^3\approx56$, an effective mass number larger five times the actual value $A=11$. To be noted that the actual mass number predicts a ``systematic'' value of the nuclear radius $R_0(^{11}\text{Li})\approx 2.7$ fm.


The above results testify to a very large ``\emph{isotropic radial deformation}'', \idx{Halo (single Cooper pair) nucleus $^{11}$Li!isotropic radial deformation}
 or halo region (skin), in keeping with the fact\footnote{\label{f155C4} \idx{Halo (single Cooper pair) nucleus $^{11}$Li!isotropic radial deformation}
 	 Let us  parametrize the radius of $^{11}$Li as (see \cite{Bohr:75}), $R=R_0(1+\alpha_{00}Y_{00})=R_0(1+\beta_{0}\frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi}})$. Thus $\beta_0=\sqrt{4\pi}(\frac{R}{R_0}-1)\approx 2.96$ which testifies to the extreme ``exoticity'' of the phenomenon.} that $R(^{11}$Li)-$R_0(^{9}$Li)=$R_0(^{9}$Li)$(\frac{R(^{11}\text{Li})}{R_0(^9\text{Li})}-1)=0.83R_0(^9\text{Li})$. In other words, $^{11}$Li can be viewed as made out of a normal $^{9}$Li core and of a skin made out of two neutrons   extending over a shell of width of the order of that of the core radius. But even more important, it is the fashion in which the above mentioned ``deformation'' affects nuclear matter. Matter  which is little complient to undergo either compressions or, for that sake, ``depressions'', without resulting in nuclear instability. In one case, through a mini supernova. In the second, by obliterating the effect of the short range strong force acting in the $^1S_0$ channel (screening effect of the bare pairing interaction).


In fact, in the case of the halo Cooper pair of $^{11}$Li, that is of the last two weakly bound neutrons, one is dealing with a rarefied nuclear atmosphere of density
\begin{align}\label{eq5App3E}
\rho\approx\frac{2}{\frac{4\pi}{3}(R^3(^{11}\text{Li})-R_0^3(^{9}\text{Li}))}\approx 0.6\times 10^{-2}\,\text{fm}^{-3}
\end{align}
where the value $R_0(^9\text{Li})\approx 2.5$ fm was used. That is, we are dealing with pairing in a nuclear system at a density which is only 4\% of saturation density.

The quest for the long range pairing mechanism which is at the basis of the binding of the halo Cooper pair of $^{11}$Li to the $^9$Li core ($S_{2n}\approx0.380$ keV, to be compared to typical systematic values of $S_{2n}\approx 16$ MeV), has lead to the discovery of what can be considered a novel nuclear mode of elementary excitation. The symbiotic halo pair addition mode, which has to carry its own source of binding (glue). A novel embodiment of the Axel--Brink scenario in which not only the line shape, but the main structure of the resonance depends on the state on which it is built, and to which it is deeply interweaved as to guarantee its stability\footnote{\cite{Axel:62,Brink:55}.} and thus its own existence. It also provides a novel realization of the Bardeen-Fr\"olich-Pines\footnote{\cite{Bardeen:55,Frohlich:52}.} microscopic mechanism to break gauge invariance: \idx{Halo (single Cooper pair) nucleus $^{11}$Li!symbiotic (bootstrap) mechanism to break gauge invariance}
through the exchange of quite large dipole ZPF which ensures the same symmetries of the original Hamiltonian to a system displaying essentially a permanent dipole moment, as a consequence of the almost degeneracy of the  pygmy dipole resonance (centroid $\approx0.75$ MeV) \idx{Halo (single Cooper pair) nucleus $^{11}$Li!soft $E1$-mode (pygmy dipole resonance)}
 with the ground state\footnote{\cite{Aumann:19}.}. An example of a van der Waals Cooper pair (Sect. \ref{C2SG2}).\idx{Cooper pair!van der Waals}



The NFT diagram shown in Fig. \ref{fig2.A.1} describing this binding seems quite involved and high order. Thus unlikely to be at the basis of a new elementary mode of nuclear excitation, if nothing else because of the apparent lack of ``elementarity'. This is not the case and, in fact, the physics at the basis of the process depicted by the oyster-like and eagle-like networks displayed in (a) and (b) is quite simple and recurrent throughout nuclear structure and reactions, let alone many-body theories and QED. In fact, it encompasses (see Fig. \ref{fig2.A.1}): (I,II) \idx{Dynamical binding} the changes in energy of single-particle levels as a function of  quadrupole dynamical deformations leading to a Jahn-Teller like effect (III) the interaction between particles through the exchange of (quasi) bosons (vibrations), (IV,V) Pauli principle leading to a conspicuous Lamb shift-like effect, (VI,VII) the softening of collective modes due to ground state correlations ((ZPF)-components, QRPA),(VIII) the interaction between two non-polar systems through virtual, ZPF associated dynamical dipoles.


 Referring to general many-degrees of freedom systems, (I,II) and (III) are at the basis of the fact that, in QED, the coupling between one- and two- photons is zero (Furry's theorem). It is also related, through cancellation processes, to the small width displayed by (particle-hole) nuclear giant resonances, as well as of inhomogeneous damping of nuclear  rotational motion at finite temperatures\footnote{\cite{Broglia:87}.} --parallel to motional narrowing observed in NMR--  as compared with the  width of single-particles at  similar excitation energies\footnote{See Sect. \ref{S5.5.1}.}. Concerning (VIII), one can mention resonant interactions between fluctuating systems like e.g. two coupled harmonic oscillators\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Born:69}, App. XL p. 471.}. 




In the case of halo Cooper pair binding by PDR in $^{11}$Li, the system although not being on resonance it is not far from it, in keeping with the fact $\widetilde\epsilon_{p_{1/2}}-\widetilde\epsilon_{s_{1/2}}\approx 0.45$ MeV and $\hbar\omega_{PDR}\approx0.75$ MeV with a width of $\approx0.5$ MeV. In other words the $^{10}$Li inverted parity system is poised to acquire a permanent dipole moment or, almost equivalent, to display a large amplitude, dipole mode at very low energy as well as a collective $B(E1)$ to the halo ground state, of the order of a single-particle Weisskopf unit $B_{W}(E1)$. The PDR (see Fig. \ref{fig3.8.1}, see also Fig. \ref{fig1.9.1}) is in $^{11}$Li  screened from the GDR through the poor overlap between core and halo single-particle wavefunctions. In this way, is able to retain essentially all of its  $E1$-strength ($\approx1\times B_{W}$), and can likely be considered a new mode of excitation\footnote{See \cite{Broglia:19} and references therein.}. Said it differently, one is faced, already at the level of the single-particle spectrum (parity inversion), with the possibility of a plastic large amplitude dipole mode, as can be seen from  
\begin{align}\label{eq3C6}
\frac{dn}{d\beta_L}=\frac{1}{4}\sqrt{\frac{2L+1}{3\pi}}A. \idx{Dynamical binding}
\end{align}  
Relation which defines the number of level crossings $n$, in terms of the isotropic radial deformation\footnote{\cite{Brink:05}, Eq. (7.35) and refs. therein. See also footnote \ref{f155C4} of this chapter.} \idx{Halo (single Cooper pair) nucleus $^{11}$Li!isotropic radial deformation}
($L=0$ and $\beta_0=2.96$),  leading to $n\approx 3$.
\section[Simple estimate]{Pairing spatial (angular) correlation: simple estimate}\label{app3D}
\idx{Cooper pair!--angular correlation}
Let us assume two equal nucleons above closed shell as the nuclear embodiment of Cooper's model. The two-particle wave function in configuration space can be written as,
\begin{align}\label{eq1App3E}
\Psi(\mathbf r_1\sigma_1,\mathbf r_2\sigma_2)=\Psi_0(\mathbf r_1,\mathbf r_2)\chi_{S=0}(\sigma_1,\sigma_2)+\left[\Psi_1(\mathbf r_1,\mathbf r_2)\chi_{S=1}(\sigma_1\sigma_2)\right]_0,
\end{align}
where $\chi_{S=0}$ and $\chi_{S=1}$ are the singlet and triplet spin wavefunctions, respectively.

In what follows we shall consider a pairing interaction acting on pairs of particles moving in time reversal states. Consequently we shall concentrate in the spin singlet radial component of (\ref{eq1App3E}). In the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (in keeping with Cooper ansatz) one can write
\begin{align}\label{eq2App3E}
\Psi_0(\mathbf r_1,\mathbf r_2)=\sum_{nn'lj}X_{nn'lj}R_{nl}(r_1)R_{n'l}(r_2)\sqrt{\frac{2j+1}{2(2l+1)}}\left[Y_l(\hat r_1)Y_l(\hat r_2)\right]_0.
\end{align}
This wave function can be rewritten as
\begin{align}\label{eq3App3Ex}
\nonumber\Psi_0(\mathbf r_1,&\mathbf r_2)=\Psi_0(|\mathbf r_1|,|\mathbf r_2|,\theta)\\
&=\sum_{n'nlj}X_{nn'lj}R_{nl}(r_1)R_{n'l}(r_2)\sqrt{\frac{2j+1}{2}}\frac{1}{4\pi}P_l(\cos\theta),
\end{align}
where $\theta=\widehat{r_1r_2}$. A convenient way to display two-particle correlation is by plotting $|\Psi_0(|\mathbf r_1|,|\mathbf r_2|,\theta)|^2$ in the $x-z$ plane.





In the case of pure configurations $a\equiv nlj$,
\begin{align}\label{eq4App3Ex}
\Psi_0(|\mathbf r_1|,|\mathbf r_2|,\theta)
=R_{nl}(r_1)R_{nl}(r_2)\sqrt{\frac{2j+1}{2}}\frac{1}{4\pi}P_l(\cos\theta).
\end{align}
In keeping with the fact that the specific probe of pairing correlation is two--nucleon transfer, a phenomenon which takes place mainly, although not only, on the nuclear surface, we shall set $r_1=r_2=R_0$, and use the empirical relation\footnote{\cite{Bohr:69}.}
\begin{align}\label{eq5App3Ex}
R_{nl}(R_0)=\left(\frac{1.4}{R_0^3}\right)^{1/2},
\end{align}
Thus 
\begin{align}\label{eq6App3E}
\Psi_0(R_0,R_0,\theta)
=\left(\frac{1.4}{R_0^3}\right)\sqrt{\frac{2j+1}{2}}\frac{1}{4\pi}P_l(\cos\theta).
\end{align}
and 
\begin{align}\label{eq7App3E}
|\Psi_0(R_0,R_0,\theta)|^2\sim |P_l(\cos\theta)|^2.
\end{align}
It is seen that the two particles have the same probability to be on top of each other ($\theta=0^\circ$; $P_l(1)=1$), or on opposite sides of the nucleus ($\theta=180^\circ; P_l(-1)=(-1)^l$). Taking into account the actual radial dependence of $R^2_{nl}(r_1)$ for $r_1=R_0$, the width of the two probability peaks is found to be $\approx 2$ fm, i.e. $d\approx\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}R^3/A\right)^{1/3}$.

Let us now consider the general expression (\ref{eq3App3Ex}), and assume, aside from $n=n'$, that  the two nucleons are allowed to correlate in a phase space composed of $N$ single--particle levels, and that all amplitudes are equal,
\begin{align}\label{eq8App3E}
X\approx\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}.
\end{align}
Thus 

\begin{align}\label{eq9App3E}
\Psi_0(R_0,R_0,\theta)
=\left(\frac{1.4}{R_0^3}\right)\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\frac{1}{4\pi}\sqrt{\frac{2j+1}{2}}\sum_lP_l(\cos\theta),
\end{align}
where again (\ref{eq5App3Ex}) have been used. One can then  write 

\begin{align}\label{eq10App3E}
|\Psi_0(R_0,R_0,\theta)|^2\sim |\sum_lP_l(\cos\theta)|^2.
\end{align}
Assuming the closed shell nucleus to be $^{208}$Pb and  the $N$ single-particle levels  the neutron valence orbitals $2g_{9/2},1i_{11/2},1j_{15/2},3d_{5/2},4s_{1/2},2g_{7/2}$ and $3d_{3/2}$, one obtains
\begin{align}\label{eq11App3E}
\frac{|\Psi_0(R_0,R_0,\theta=0^\circ)|^2}{|\Psi_0(R_0,R_0,\theta=180^\circ)|^2}\approx\left(\frac{7}{5}\right)^2\approx2,
\end{align}
in keeping with the fact that there is only a single state of opposite parity (intruder $j_{15/2}$ state).

Making use of an extended basis, containing a similar amount of positive and negative natural parity states, that is taking into account a large number of major shells ($\pi=(-1)^N, N$ principal quantum number), one can reduce in a consistent fashion the value of $|\Psi_0(R_0,R_0,\theta=180^\circ)|^2$.
This of course materializes already within the basis of valence states in e.g. $^{11}$Li, in keeping with the fact that in this case $s_{1/2}$ and $p_{1/2}$ play, in the ground state, a similar role (see Fig. \ref{fig8_1_2}). 


Summing up, the above results have something to do with the Cooper pair problem, but much more with the peculiarities of spatial quantization associated with the nuclear self-bound many-body system at the level of mean field. That is, the nuclear Cooper pair phenomenon  is to be expressed under the influence of a very strong external field which imposes not only confinement, but also spatial quantization with strong spin orbit effects resulting, among other things, in intruder states and thus parity mixing, let alone parity inversion due to quadrupole fluctuation of the mean field.   

\section{Hindsight}\label{C3AppE}
The formulation of superconductivity (BCS theory) described by  Gor'kov\footnote{\cite{Gorkov:58,Gorkov:59}.} allows, among other things for a simple visualization of spatial dependences. In this formulation $F(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')$ is the amplitude for two Fermions (electrons) at $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}'$, to belong to the Cooper pair (within the framework of nuclear physics cf. e.g. Fig. \ref{fig1F3} $\Psi_0(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2)$; see also Sect. \ref{App3B}). The phase of $F$ is closely  related to the angular orientation of the spin variable  in Anderson's quasispin formulation of BCS theory\footnote{\cite{Anderson:58b}; within the framework of nuclear physics cf. e.g. \cite{Bohr:88}, \cite{Potel:13b} and references therein.}. The gap function $\Delta(x)$ is given by $V(\mathbf{x})F(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})$ where $V(\mathbf{x})$ is the local two--body interaction at the point $\mathbf x$. In the insulating barrier between the two superconductors of a Josephson junction, $V(\mathbf{x})$ is zero and thus $\Delta(x)$ is also zero. 



The crucial point is that vanishing\footnote{This point was likely misunderstood by Bardeen who writes``\dots In my view, virtual pair excitations do not extend across the layer\dots'', see \cite{McDonald:01}, see also \cite{Bardeen:61} and \cite{Bardeen:62}.} $\Delta(x)$ does not imply vanishing $F$ (abnormal density), provided, of course, that one has within the junction, a non-zero particle (electron) density, resulting from the overlap of densities from right (R) and left (L) superconductors. These junctions are such that they allow for one-electron-tunneling with a probability $P_1$ quite small, but finite  and, consequently, the above requirement is fulfilled. Nonetheless, conventional  simultaneous pair transfer, with a probability $P_1^2$ will not be observed\footnote{\cite{Pippard:12}.}. \textit{But because one electron at a time can tunnel profiting of the small, but finite electron density within the junction layer,   $F(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')$ can have a sizable amplitude for Cooper pairs with partners electrons one on each side of the barrier (i.e. $\mathbf x\in$ L and $\mathbf x'\in$ R), separated by distances $|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'|$ up to the coherence length}. Hence, for barriers  thin compared with the coherence length, two electrons on opposite sides of the barrier can still be correlated and the pair current   be consistent. An evaluation of its 
value shows that, at zero temperature, the pair current is equal to $\pi/4$ times the normal, single (quasiparticle) electron carrier current, at an equivalent voltage\footnote{In the case of Pb at low temperatures ($\approx7.19$ K (0.62 meV)) this voltage is $\approx 1$ meV/$e=1$ mV leading to $\approx$2mA current for a barrier resistance of $R\sim1\Omega$ (\cite{Ambegaokar:63,McDonald:01,Tinkham:96}).} $2\Delta/e$.
Evaluation which has been experimentally confirmed\footnote{\cite{Rogalla:12}.}.

The translation of the above parlance to the language of nuclear physics has to come to terms with the basic fact that nuclei are self-bound, finite many-body systems in which the surface, as well as the closely related property of spatial quantization, play an important role both as a static element of confinement, as well as a dynamic source for renormalization effects\footnote{Within this context it is of notice that the liquid drop model is a very successful nuclear model, able to accurately describe not only large amplitude motion (fission, exotic decay, low-lying collective  surface vibrations, cf. e.g. \cite{Bohr:39}, \cite{Bertsch:88b}, \cite{Barranco:90}, and references therein), but also the masses of nuclides (see e.g. \cite{Moller:95}), provided the superfluid inertia and shell corrections respectively, are properly considered. Thus, it is likely that in the quest of  more predictive theoretical tools of the global nuclear properties one should develop on equal footing ever more ``accurate'' bare $NN$-potentials as well as effective forces, and methods to deal with the long wavelength, renormalization effects and induced interactions. Within this context it is illuminating the contribution of \cite{Anderson:62} concerning the nuclear surface diffuseness, at the time of the development of  Brueckner theory (\cite{Brueckner:61}).}$^,$\footnote{\cite{Broglia:02d}.}.
Under the influence of the average potential which can be viewed as very strong external field $(|V_0|\approx 50$ MeV), Cooper pairs ($|E_{corr}|\approx 2$ MeV) will become constrained within its boundaries with some amount of spill out. 


Let us now consider a two nucleon transfer reaction in the collision Sn+Sn assuming a distance of closest approach of $\approx 14$ fm, in which the two nuclear surfaces are separated by $\approx 2$ fm (Fig \ref{fig_1}). In keeping with the fact that this distance is about 3$\times a$, the heavy ion system will display a few percent overlap of (normal, saturation) density. Ever so small this overlap and so narrow the surface hole between the two leptodermic systems resulting from  it,  Cooper pairs can now extend over the two volumes, in a similar way as electron Cooper pairs could  partially be found in the R and L superconductors in a Josephson junction. If this is the case, Cooper pair partners can, in principle, be at distances of the order of the  correlation length (see Sects. \ref{App4.B.3} and \ref{S7.3}). 

An example of the fact that Cooper pairs will ``expand'' if the external mean field allows for it, is provided by $^{11}$Li \idx{Cooper pair!--confinement (by an external field)}
 in which case, profiting of the weak binding ($\approx 380$ keV), the extension of the constrained Cooper  pair ($\approx 4.58 $ fm $\pm 0.13$ fm)   is similar to that expected in a nucleus of mass number $A\approx 60$, assuming a standard radial behavior, i.e. $r_0 A^{1/3}$ fm. In keeping with this scenario, it could be expected that moving from one neutron pair addition $0^+$ mode of the $N=6$ isotones\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Gori:04}.} to another one ($|^{11}\text{Li(gs)}\rangle$, $|^{12}\text{Be(gs)}\rangle$ and $|^{12}\text{Be}(0^{+*};2.24\,\text{MeV})\rangle$) one would see the system expanding, contracting and expanding again, respectively, in keeping with the fact that the external (mean) field is weak, strong, weak respectively, as testified by $S_{2n}$ (380 keV, 3672 keV, 1432 keV).  
Within this context, in Fig. \ref{fig3.8.1} a schematic overall view of the pairing vibrational modes associated with $N=6$ parity inverted closed shell isotones, together with low-energy $E1$-strength modes is given. The possible candidates to the role of neutron halo pair addition modes and symbiotic state are explicitly indicated (boxed levels).

\section[Coherent state]{Coherent state}\label{App3E}
\idx{BCS!--(coherent) state}
The BCS ground state can be written as,
\begin{align}\label{eq1App3Ex} 
\nonumber \ket{BCS(\phi)}_{\mathcal K}&=\prod_{\nu>0}\left(U_\nu+V_\nu a_\nu^\dagger a_{\bar{\nu}}^\dagger\right)\ket{0}=\prod_{\nu>0}U_\nu\left(1+\frac{V_\nu}{U_\nu} a_\nu^\dagger a_{\bar{\nu}}^\dagger\right)\ket{0}\\
&=\left(\prod_{\nu>0}U_\nu\right)\left(\prod_{\nu>0}\left(1+c_\nu P^\dagger\right)\right)\ket{0},
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}\label{eq2App3Ex} 
 c_\nu=\frac{V_\nu}{U_\nu}\quad\text{and}\quad P^\dagger=a_\nu^\dagger a_{\bar{\nu}}^\dagger.
\end{align}
In what follows, we work out a couple of simple examples:\\
\textbf{a) $\nu$=1,2 (two pairs),}
\begin{align}\label{eq2App4Ex} 
 \nonumber \prod_{\nu>0}\left(1+c_\nu P^\dagger\right)&=\left(1+c_1P_1^\dagger\right)\left(1+c_2P_2^\dagger\right)=1+c_1P_1^\dagger+c_2P_2^\dagger\\
 &+c_1c_2P_1^\dagger P_2^\dagger=1+\sum_{\nu>0}c_\nu P_\nu^\dagger + \frac{1}{2!}\left(\sum_{\nu>0}c_\nu P^\dagger_\nu\right)^2,
\end{align}
where use has been made of
\begin{align}\label{eq2App5Ex} 
\left(c_1P_1^\dagger+ c_2P_2^\dagger\right)^2=2c_1c_2P_1^\dagger P_2^\dagger,
\end{align}
in keeping with  the fact that
\begin{align}\label{eq2App6Ex}
\left(P_1^\dagger\right)^2=\left(P_2^\dagger\right)^2=0.
\end{align}
\textit{The above expression underscores the fact that Cooper pairs are not bosons.}\\
\textbf{b) $\nu$=1,2,3 (three pairs):}
\begin{align}\label{eq2App7Ex}
\nonumber \prod_{\nu>0}\left(1+c_\nu P^\dagger\right)&=\left(1+c_3P_3^\dagger\right)\left(1+c_2P_2^\dagger\right)\left(1+c_1P_1^\dagger\right)\\
\nonumber &=\left(1+c_3P_3^\dagger\right)\left(1+c_1P_1^\dagger+c_2P_2^\dagger+c_1c_2P_1^\dagger P_2^\dagger\right)\\
\nonumber&=1+\left(c_1P_1^\dagger+c_2P_2^\dagger+c_3P_3^\dagger\right)+\left(c_1c_2P_1^\dagger P_2^\dagger+c_1c_3P_1^\dagger P_3^\dagger+c_2c_3P_2^\dagger P_3^\dagger\right)\\
&+c_1c_2c_3P_1^\dagger P_2^\dagger P_3^\dagger=1+\sum_{\nu>0}c_\nu P_\nu^\dagger + \frac{1}{2!}\left(\sum_{\nu>0}c_\nu P^\dagger_\nu\right)^2+\frac{1}{3!}\left(\sum_{\nu>0}c_\nu P^\dagger_\nu\right)^3,
\end{align}
where use has been made of the relations (\ref{eq2App6Ex}) and of,
\begin{align}
\nonumber \left[\left(a+b+c\right)\left(a+b+c\right)\right]&=ab+ac+ba +bc+ca+cb=2ab+2ac+2bc,\\
\nonumber & a^2=b^2=c^2=0,
\end{align}
together with
\begin{align}\label{eq2App9Ex}
 (a+b+c)\left[\left(a+b+c\right)\left(a+b+c\right)\right]=2abc+2bac+2cab=6abc.
\end{align}
Thus,
\begin{align}\label{eq2App10Ex}
\left(\sum_{\nu>0}c_\nu P_\nu^\dagger\right)^3=6c_1c_2c_3P_1^\dagger P_2^\dagger P_3^\dagger=3!c_1c_2c_3P_1^\dagger P_2^\dagger P_3^\dagger
\end{align}
Making use of
\begin{align}\label{eq2App11Ex}
e^x=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\cdots,
\end{align}
one can write
\begin{align}\label{eq1App11Ex} 
\nonumber &\ket{BCS(\phi)}_{\mathcal K}=\left(\prod_{\nu>0}U_\nu\right)\left\{1+\frac{1}{1!}\left(\sum_{\nu>0}c_\nu P_\nu^\dagger\right)+\frac{1}{2!}\left(\sum_{\nu>0}c_\nu P_\nu^\dagger\right)^2+\frac{1}{3!}\left(\sum_{\nu>0}c_\nu P_\nu^\dagger\right)^3+\cdots\right\}\ket{0},\\
&=\left(\prod_{\nu>0}U'_\nu\right)\left\{1+\frac{e^{-2i\phi}}{1!}\left(\sum_{\nu>0}c'_\nu P_\nu^\dagger\right)+\frac{e^{-4i\phi}}{2!}\left(\sum_{\nu>0}c'_\nu P_\nu^\dagger\right)^2+\frac{e^{-6i\phi}}{3!}\left(\sum_{\nu>0}c'_\nu P_\nu^\dagger\right)^3+\cdots\right\}\ket{0},
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}\label{eq2App12Ex}
 c_\nu=e^{-2i\phi}c_\nu',\quad c'_\nu=V'_\nu/U'_\nu.
\end{align}
Thus,
\begin{align}\label{eq2App13Ex}
\nonumber\ket{BCS(\phi)}_{\mathcal K}&=\left(\prod_{\nu>0}U_\nu\right)\exp\left(\sum_{\nu>0}c_\nu P_\nu^\dagger\right)\ket{0}=\left(\prod_{\nu>0}U_\nu\right)\sum_{n=0,1,2,\dots}\frac{\left(\sum_{\nu>0}c_\nu P^\dagger_\nu\right)^n}{n!}\ket{0}\\
&=\left(\prod_{\nu>0}U'_\nu\right)\sum_{N \text{ even}}\frac{e^{-iN\phi}}{(N/2)!}\left(\sum_{\nu>0}c'_\nu P_\nu^\dagger\right)^{N/2}\ket{0},
\end{align}
(see Eq. (\ref{eq3.7.27})) and
\begin{align}\label{eq2App14Ex}
\nonumber\ket{N_0}&=\int d\phi e^{iN_0\phi}\ket{BCS(\phi)}_{\mathcal K}\\
&=\left(\prod_{\nu>0}U'_\nu\right)\sum_{N \text{ even}}\int d\phi e^{iN_0\phi}\frac{e^{-iN\phi}}{(N/2)!}\left(\sum_{\nu>0}c'_\nu P_\nu^\dagger\right)^{N/2}\ket{0}\sim\left(\sum_{\nu>0}c'_\nu P_\nu^\dagger\right)^{N_0/2}\ket{0},
\end{align}
is the member with $N_0$ particles of the pairing rotational band, while
\begin{align}\label{eq2App15Ex}
\left(\sum_{\nu>0}c'_\nu P_\nu^\dagger\right)\ket{0}, \idx{Cooper pair!--state}
\end{align}
is the Cooper pair state. Because $U'_\nu\to 0$ for $\epsilon\ll \epsilon_F$, (\ref{eq2App15Ex}) is to be interpreted to be valid for values of $\epsilon_\nu$ close to $\epsilon_F$. In expression (\ref{eq2App13Ex}), $n=N/2$ is the number of Cooper pairs.


Making use of the single $j$-shell model
\begin{align}\label{eq2App16Ex}
V'=\sqrt{\frac{N}{2\Omega}},\quad U'=\sqrt{1-\frac{N}{2\Omega}},
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}\label{eq2App17Ex}
\frac{V'}{U'}=\sqrt{\frac{N}{2\Omega-N}}\approx U'V'\left(1+\mathcal O\left(\frac{N}{2\Omega}\right)\right),
\end{align}
for a number of particles considerably smaller than the full degeneracy of the single-particle subspace in which nucleons can correlate, that is for $N\ll2\Omega$. Consequently, one can write
\begin{align}\label{eq2App18Ex}
\ket{\tilde 0}\approx\frac{1}{\sqrt{ N_{norm}}}\sum_{\nu>0}(\alpha'_0)_\nu P^\dagger_\nu\ket{0},
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}\label{eq2App19Ex}
(\alpha'_0)_\nu =\braket{BCS|P^\dagger_\nu|BCS}=U'_\nu V'_\nu,
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}\label{eq2App20Ex}
N_{norm}=\sum_{\nu>0}(\alpha'_0)_\nu^2.
\end{align}
