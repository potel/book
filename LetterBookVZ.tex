Dear Vladimir


During the last few years we have been working on a monograph on the subject of nuclear structure and reactions, setting special emphasis on the probing of pairing correlations with two--nucleon transfer reactions.

As you know, such projects are not easy to carry out, and advice from colleagues and students are precious.

Within this context we will be delighted if you could look at the material we are sending you (both as a paper copy and as a .pdf file), and eventually give us your comments, suggestions and criticism.
Best personal regards,

	P/S: Needless to say, being the project still in a somewhat preliminary stage, we shall appreciate if you treat the material we send you as confidential.
