Chpt. 3:
Overall, I like this chapter very much!
- Fig. 3.2.15 exceeds the layout of the text width
- Fig. 3.3.1  check the text-inlay and caption:  q meany Q? Mis-adjustment of "a~"
- a general remark: mean field (your use) or mean-field (widely used in the literature)?
- Fig. 3.4.1.: bad quality - at least in the proof copy
- why do you change to small initial letters in subsections 3.4.1/3.4.2
- Fig. 3.4.2.: another example for a figure which works well as a transpareny but may put the reader in despair when printed
- Fig. 3.5.2/ 3.5.3 and 3.5.4/3.5.5: why are you using different layouts (small vs. bold lines) for the two diagrams? It might be even better to combine the two graphs into one figure 
- title of sect. 3.6: "Halo pair addition mode and pygmy:..." the left alone "pygmy" reads like a fragment of a sentence waiting for completion
- "clothed" is a bit unusual compared, main use is "dressed"
- Fig. 3.A.1 comes around a bit overcrowded and exceeds the text layout
- check type-setting of "^9LI(t,p)..." on p. 229
- the hand-drawn diagrams in the App. 3.D are artful but fall out of the scheme of the book
