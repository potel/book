 \chapter{Probing Cooper pairs with pair transfer}\label{C8}
  \epigraph{\dots I advocated the application of the word \textit{phenomenon} exclusively to refer to the observation obtained under specified circumstances, including the account of the whole experimental arrangement.}{Niels Bohr}
Pairing density, both static ($n_{st}=e^{-2i\phi}\alpha'_0/V$) and dynamic\footnote{See Figs. \ref{fig1_E8} and \ref{fig3.3.2}.} ($\alpha_{dyn}/V)$, can exist only to the extent that normal density exists. At the basis of \textit{normal density} one finds independent nucleon (fermion) motion in a non local mean field, created by all nucleons. At the basis of pair (\textit{abnormal}) density one finds the conversion of this motion into long range correlated motion of extended, strongly overlapping, weakly bound pairs  of nucleons (quasi-bosons), moving in time reversal states close to the Fermi energy displaying \textit{off diagonal long range order}. Because the mean square radius of a Cooper pair is considerably larger than nuclear dimensions, the average potential acts on them as a strong external field and affects their structure and dynamics \idx{Cooper pair!--confinement (by an external field)}
. A fact whose implications have become physically clearer in the study of the structure of the two-neutron  halo nucleus $^{11}$Li and, quantitatively more accurate, by probing the system through pair transfer. \textit{Said it differently, Cooper pairs are at the basis of (both static and dynamic) spontaneous breaking of gauge invariance, namely of conservation (of pairs) of particle number. To study the specific consequence of a broken symmetry one needs a probe which itself breaks the symmetry. In the present case a probe which changes in two particle number, like a nuclear reaction inducing  pair transfer.}

Within the above scenario we apply, in   what follows, the formalism worked out in the previous chapters, to analyze Cooper pair transfer reactions. In the calculation of the corresponding absolute differential cross sections, use has been made of the computer code \textsc{cooper} (App. \ref{C8AppD}).
 A number of examples are considered covering nuclei throughout the mass table. Namely,   two-particle transfer  in $^{10}$Be,    $^{7}$Li, $^{11}$Li, $^{48}$Ca, and $^{206}$Pb (systems around closed shells), and on single open shell superfluid   medium heavy nuclei ($^{60}$Ni and Sn-isotopes), induced both by light and heavy ions.

 We start by discussing  the analysis of the two-neutron pickup\footnote{\cite{Tanihata:08}.} reaction\\ $^1$H($^{11}$Li,$^9$Li)$^3$H. The results  provide evidence for a new mechanism of pairing correlations in nuclei: pygmy dipole resonance (low-energy $E1$-strength) mediated pairing interaction\footnote{\citet{Barranco:01,Potel:10}.}, which strongly renormalizes the bare, $NN$-$^1S_0$ interaction. This is but a particular embodiment of (quasi) phonon mediated pairing interaction found  in nuclei, throughout the mass table\footnote{See footnote \ref{f53C3} Ch. \ref{chapter1} and refs. therein.}. Attention is also paid to the  population of the $1/2^-$ first excited state of $^9$Li lying\footnote{To assess the direct character of the $1/2^-$ excitation process, the importance of (two-step) inelastic  and of knockout  channels were considered and found to be small (see Sect. \ref{C8AppB}).} at 2.69 MeV (see Figs. \ref{fig1.9.2}--\ref{figintro6x} and  \ref{fig8_1_3}). 
 
 
  The main difference between light halo exotic nuclei and medium heavy  nuclei lying along the valley of stability is the role fluctuations play in dressing particles (quasiparticles) and in renormalizing their properties (mass, charge, etc.) and their interactions, like the pairing interaction.

 In fact, in the case of e.g. Sn isotopes, mean field effects are dominant, while in the case of halo exotic nuclei renormalization effects can be as large as mean field ones. Concerning the pairing interaction, bare and induced contributions are about equal in the case of i.e. Sn-isotopes, while the second one is the overwhelming contribution in the case of $^{11}$Li. The collective modes acting as glue of the Cooper pairs are mainly of quadrupole type in Sn and of dipole (pygmy resonance)\footnote{Within this context see \cite{Broglia:19}.} type in the case of $^{11}$Li. In what follows we summarize aspects of structure and reaction which, interweaved shed insight into this single Cooper pair halo nucleus, and allows to compare theory with experiment in terms of absolute differential cross sections.

 
 

 
 

\subsection{Structure}
The ground state of $^{11}$Li is written as  
\begin{equation}\label{eq8_2_0}
\ket{gs\,(^{11}\text{Li})}=\ket{\widetilde {0}}_\nu\otimes\ket{p_{3/2}(\pi)},
\end{equation}
where the proton state is assumed to act as a spectator, and where the two halo correlated neutrons are described by the state 
\begin{equation}\label{eq8_2_1}
|0\rangle_\nu=|0\rangle+\alpha|(p_{1/2},s_{1/2})_{1^-}\otimes 1^-;0\rangle+\beta|(s_{1/2},d_{5/2})_{2^+}\otimes 2^+;0\rangle,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}\label{eq8_2_2}
\alpha=0.7,\quad \text{and} \quad \beta=0.1,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eq8_2_3}
|0\rangle=0.45|s_{1/2}^2(0)\rangle+0.55|p_{1/2}^2(0)\rangle+0.04|d_{5/2}^2(0)\rangle,
\end{equation}
$|1^-\rangle$ and $|2^+\rangle$ being the (QRPA) states describing the pygmy dipole  resonance of $^{11}$Li and the low-lying quadrupole vibration of the core $^9$Li.

\textit{We are then in presence of a paradigmatic nuclear embodiment of Cooper's model which is at the basis of BCS theory: a single weakly bound neutron pair on top of the Fermi surface, namely the  ${}^9$Li core}. But the analogy goes beyond these aspects, and covers also the very nature of the interaction acting between Cooper pair partners  (pairing interaction). Due to the  the high polarizability of the system under study and of the small overlap of halo and core single particle wavefunctions, most of the Cooper pair correlation energy stems from the exchange of collective vibrations, the role of the strongly screened bare pairing interaction being, in this case, subcritical  (see Sect. \ref{App1AF}). In other words, we are in the presence of a new realization of the Cooper model in which a totally novel Bardeen-Pines-Fr\"olich-like phonon induced pairing interaction is generated by a self induced collective vibration of the nuclear medium.



 In connection with  (\ref{eq8_2_1}), it is revealing that the  state populated in the  inverse kinematics, two-neutron pick up reaction $^1$H($^{11}$Li,$^9$Li)$^3$H is, aside from the ground $|3/2^-\text{gs}\,(^9\text{Li})\rangle$ state,  the first excited $|1/2^-,2.69\,\text{MeV}\,(^9\text{Li})\rangle$ level. The associated absolute differential cross sections calculated making use of the spectroscopic amplitudes displayed in Eqs. (\ref{eq8_2_1})-(\ref{eq8_2_3}) and of the optical potentials collected in Table \ref{tab8.1.1}, provide a quantitative account of the experimental data  within the NFT scenario (Fig. \ref{fig8_1_2}). It is of notice that: (\textbf{a}) assuming the soft $E1$-mode to be non-operative, that is, $\alpha=0$ and normalizing to 1 (\ref{eq8_2_3}) (see Fig. \ref{fig8_1_2} lower right panel labeled $N=1$), theory overpredicts experiment by a factor of 2; (\textbf{b}) the absolute direct two-particle transfer cross section associated with the $1/2^-$ state, reflects the value of the amplitude $\alpha$. 
 
 
 
 
 
 \subsection{Reaction}\label{C8AppB}
 In the reaction $^1$H($^{11}$Li,$^9$Li)$^3$H,
 the $1/2^-$ (2.69 MeV) first excited state of $^9$Li can, in principle, not only be populated through the direct two-particle transfer reaction channel (sum of successive and simultaneous contributions plus non-orthogonality corrections, see Fig. \ref{fig8_1_2} and Table \ref{tab8_B_1} column \textbf{2}), but also, in principle, through other channels involving breakup and inelastic processes.
 
 
  In particular, that in which one of the two neutrons moving in the $1/2^-$ orbital (component $\ket{p_{1/2}^2(0)}$ of (\ref{eq8_2_3}), see also \cite{Potel:10}, Fig 1 (f) of this reference) is picked up (forming a virtual deuteron, the other $1/2^-$ going into the continuum, i.e. breaking up from the $^9$Li core) together with a neutron from the $p_{3/2}$ orbital. Orbital which eventually has the possibility to couple with a new bound $p_{1/2}$ neutron state, resulting from the falling of the continuum $p_{1/2}$ neutron back into that orbital,   leaving the core in the quadrupole excited state. This is in keeping with the fact that the main amplitude of this vibration is\footnote{\cite{Barranco:01}.} the  $X(1p^{-1}_{3/2},1p_{1/2})$ (see column \textbf{3} of Table \ref{tab8_B_1}). In the second process involving breakup, the proton field ($^1$H) acting once breaks the halo Cooper pair (assumed again to be in the $\ket{p_{1/2}^2(0)}$ component), forcing one of the $1/2^-$ halo neutrons to populate a $p_{1/2}$ continuum state, the other $1/2^-$ neutron assumed to do the same. Acting for a second time, $^1$H picks up one of the neutrons moving in the continuum and another one from those occupying the bound $p_{3/2}$ orbital of $^{9}$Li,  which, as explained above can couple to the $p_{1/2}$ bound state into which the continuum one has fallen, leaving again the core in the quadrupole mode of excitation (see column \textbf{4} Table \ref{tab8_B_1}, see also Fig. 1 (g) \cite{Potel:10}). 
 
  In the remaining channel considered,  two-particles are transferred to the ground state of $^{9}$Li, and final state interaction (\textbf{FSI}) between the outgoing triton and $^{9}$Li results in the inelastic and Coulomb excitation of  the $1/2^-$ state (Table \ref{tab8_B_1}, column \textbf{5}, see also Fig. 1 (h) \cite{Potel:10}).
 
 
 Making use of the NFT spectroscopic amplitudes, and of computer codes developed  to microscopically take into account the different processes mentioned above, that is the different reaction channels and continuum states up to 50 MeV of excitation energy, the corresponding transfer amplitudes and associated probabilities $p_l$ were calculated.
 In Table \ref{tab8_B_1}  the probabilities $p_l=|S_l^{(c)}|^2$ associated with each of the processes mentioned above are displayed, where the amplitude $S_l^{(c)}$ is related to the total cross section associated with each of the channels $c$  by the expression\footnote{\cite{Satchler:80,Landau:81}.}
 \begin{equation}\label{eq6B1}
 \sigma_c=\frac{\pi}{k^2}\sum_l(2l+1)|S_l^{(c)}|^2,
 \end{equation}
 $k$ being the wave number of the relative motion between the reacting nuclei.
 
 
 In keeping with the small values of $p_l$,  the  contributions associated with the different reaction channels were calculated making use of second order perturbation theory. In the case of the $1/2^-$ (2.69 MeV) first excited state of $^9$Li the absolute differential cross section is thus,
 \begin{equation}
 \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}(\theta)=\frac{\mu^2}{16\pi^3\hbar^4}\left|\sum_l(2l+1)P_l(\theta)\sum_{c=2}^5 T^{(c)}_l\right|^2,
 \end{equation}
 where $\mu$ is the reduced mass and $T^{(c)}_l$ are the transition matrix elements associated with the different channels and for each partial wave of DWBA\footnote{\cite{Satchler:80}.}.

 Making use of all the elements discussed above, multistep (simultaneous, non-orthogonality and successive) transfer\footnote{\cite{Bayman:82}, \cite{Igarashi:91},  \cite{Bayman:73} as well as \cite{Broglia:04a}.}, breakup and inelastic channels were calculated, and the results displayed in Figs. \ref{fig8_B_2} and \ref{fig8_B_3}. Theory provides an overall account of the experimental findings. In particular, in connection with the $1/2^-$ state, this result essentially emerges from  multistep two-particle transfer cross section (Fig. \ref{fig8_B_3}), weighted by the corresponding nuclear structure amplitudes  (see Eqs. (\ref{eq8_2_1})--(\ref{eq8_2_3})). 
 
 
 As shown in Figs. \ref{fig8_B_2} and \ref{fig8_B_3}, the contributions of breakup  and inelastic  processes to the population of the $1/2^-$ (2.69 MeV) first excited state of $^9$Li are negligible as compared to successive two-nucleon transfer. In the case of the breakup channels, this is a consequence of the low bombarding energy of the $^{11}$Li beam (inverse kinematics), combined with the small overlap between continuum (resonant) neutron $p_{1/2}$ wavefunctions and  bound state wavefunctions. In the case of  FSI process, it is again a consequence of the relative low bombarding energy. In fact, the adiabaticity parameters $\xi_C,\xi_N$\footnote{See eqs. (IV.12) and (IV.14) of ref. \cite{Broglia:04a}.} associated with Coulomb excitation and inelastic excitation in the $t$+$^9$Li channel are larger than 1, implying an adiabatic cutoff. In other words, the quadrupole mode is essentially only polarized during the reaction but essentially not excited.

 Second order calculations of inelastic, break up and final state interaction channels, which in principle can provide alternative routes for the population of the first excited state of $^9$Li  to the direct one predicted by the wavefunction (\ref{eq8_2_1})  ($\beta$ component), lead to absolute cross sections which are smaller by few orders of magnitude than that shown in Fig. \ref{fig8_B_2}. One then can posit that quadrupole core polarization effects in $|\,\text{gs}\,(^{11}\text{Li})\rangle$ is essential to account for the observation of the $|1/2^-,2.69\,\text{MeV}\rangle$ state, and provides evidence for phonon mediated pairing in nuclei. 

 \subsection{Further examples of pairing vibrational states}\label{C6S1.2}
 In Fig. \ref{fig8_2_1} further examples of pairing vibrational states around  neutron closed shell systems are given. The fact that among the $(p,t)$ and $(t,p)$ absolute differential cross sections one also finds the $^{208}$Pb($^{16}$O,$^{18}$O)$^{206}$Pb(gs) absolute differential cross section is in keeping with the fact that the formalism to treat both light and heavy ions two-nucleon transfer reactions is rather homogeneous and well established\footnote{See footnote \ref{f29C3}  Ch. \ref{chapter1}, \cite{Bayman:82}, \cite{Broglia:04a}  and  \cite{Thompson:88} and references therein.}$^,$\footnote{\cite{Potel:13,Potel:13b}.}.

\section[Pairing rotational bands]{Pairing rotational bands}\label{C8S2}
The $\ket{BCS}$ state, which can be viewed as the intrinsic state with deformation $\alpha_0$ of a pairing rotational band (see Eq. (\ref{eq4.7.25})), is a coherent state (see Eq. (\ref{eq0.1.74})). One then expects the associated observable ($\sim|\alpha_0|^2$), namely the absolute two-nucleon transfer differential cross section, to be stable with respect to the models used to calculate the corresponding spectroscopic amplitudes $B_\nu$. That is, $B_\nu\sim U_\nu V_\nu$ and, as a consequence, the order parameter $\alpha_0=\sum_{\nu>0}U_\nu V_\nu$. 


In Table \ref{tab8_2_1} we collect the two--nucleon spectroscopic amplitudes associated with  the reactions  
$^{A+2}$Sn(p,t)$^A$ Sn, for $A$ in the interval 112--126. Making use of these results and of  global optical parameters (see Table \ref{tab8.2.2}), the absolute differential cross section $^{A+2}$Sn($p,t$)$^A$Sn(gs) were calculated. They are shown in Fig. \ref{fig8_2_4} in comparison with the data.

\subsection{Structure-reaction: stability of the order parameter $\alpha_0$}\label{C6S2.3}
 \idx{BCS!--order parameter (number of Cooper pairs)}
The order parameter associated with distortion in gauge space can be written as 
\begin{align}\label{eq7.2.1}
\alpha_0'=\sum_{j_a}\sqrt{\frac{2j_a+1}{2}}B(j^2_a(0),N\to N+2),
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}\label{eq6.4.15x}
B(j^2_a(0),N\to N+2)=\sqrt{\frac{2j_a+1}{2}}U'_{j_a}(N)V'_{j_a}(N+2) \idx{Pairing rotational bands!two-nucleon transfer spectroscopic amplitudes}
\end{align}
is the two-nucleon spectroscopic amplitude associated with the $(j^2(0))$ pair transfer between members of a pairing rotational band. Thus 
\begin{align}\label{eq6.4.15}
\alpha_0'=\sum_{j_a,m_a>0}U'_{j_a}V'_{j_a}=\sum_{j_a}\frac{2j_a+1}{2}U'_{j_a}V'_{j_a}=e^{2i\phi}\sum_{j_a}\frac{2j_a+1}{2}U_{j_a}V_{j_a}=e^{2i\phi}\alpha_0,
\end{align}
defines a privileged orientation in gauge space. \textit{Within the unified description of structure and reactions of the present monograph, the quantities (\ref{eq6.4.15x}) are the weighting factors of the successive, simultaneous and non-orthogonality formfactors (Eq. \ref{eq6.6.1}) involved in the calculation of the corresponding transfer amplitudes and associated absolute transfer differential cross sections, making use of global optical parameters. Consequently, in discussing the properties of the order parameter $\alpha_0$, in particular in this section, one has in mind the two-nucleon transfer formfactors}.  The $B$-coefficients weight the corresponding radial functions, as well as the contributions of energy denominators (Green functions) associated with the different contributions and intermediate channels.




 \textit{Empirical renormalization} is also operative in connection with these channels, in terms of selecting the associated \emph{effective $Q$-value}. Also of the distorted waves, again by selecting among possible embodiments of the \textit{optical potential}. To be noted that, within this connection, one is talking about  modest changes in the absolute differential cross sections to be used to predict new experiments, or to compare with the experimental data, as compared with the results obtained with standard choices (see  App. \ref{C8AppD}, Fig. \ref{fig7.C.1}).

\subsection{A two-nucleon transfer physical sum rule}\label{S6.4.2}
\idx{Two-nucleon transfer!physical sum rule}
\idx{Sum rules}
 In what follows we analyze the stability of $\alpha_0'$ within the framework of three theoretical schemes to calculate the $B$-amplitudes\footnote{\cite{Potel:17}.}, associated with the reaction $^{120}$Sn$(p,t)^{118}$Sn(gs). The first one corresponds to BCS approximation making use of a pairing interaction of constant matrix elements.  Starting from the HF solution of a Skyrme interaction, namely Sly4, the gap and number equations are solved in the pairing approximation with $G=0.26$ MeV leading to the empirical value of the three--point expression of the pairing gap $\Delta^{exp}\approx$1.4 MeV. The $B$-coefficients for the valence orbitals are reported in the fourth column of Table \ref{tab6.4.3}. 




In the second calculational scheme, and making use of the same Skyrme interaction and of the $v_{14}$ Argonne, $^1S_0$ $NN$-potential and neglecting the influence of the bare
pairing force in the mean field,
the HFB equation was solved. As a result, this step corresponds to an extended BCS calculation over the HF basis, allowing for the 
interference between states of equal quantum numbers $a (\equiv lj)$, and both equal and different number of nodes. One includes $(N_a)$ states
(for each $a$) up to $\approx $600 MeV, to properly take into account  the repulsive core of $v_{14}$ and be able to accurately calculate 
$\Delta^{HFB}$ (=1.08 MeV). The resulting $B$-coefficients are displayed in the third column of Table \ref{tab6.4.3}.


 Going beyond mean field,  one has to include the particle-vibration coupling mechanism leading to renormalization phenomena.  Both in the quasiparticle self-energy as well as  the  induced pairing interaction, within the framework of renormalized NFT ((NFT)$_{\text{ren}}$). Propagating the resulting dressing of the quasiparticle states with the help of the  Nambu-Gorkov (NG) equation leads, in the canonical basis, to the renormalized spectroscopic amplitudes shown in the second column of Table \ref{tab6.4.3}.

\end{table} 
Making use of these $B$-coefficients, together with the global optical parameters reported in Table \ref{tab8.2.2}, the corresponding absolute differential cross sections associated with the reaction $^{120}$Sn$(p,t)^{118}$Sn(gs) at 21 MeV of bombarding energy were calculated.  They are displayed in Figs. \ref{fig6.4.2} and \ref{fig6.4.3} in comparison with the experimental findings.  The absolute cross section ratio $|\sigma_i-\sigma_{exp}|/\sigma_{exp}$ is equal to 0.09, 0.13 and 0.07 ($i=$ BCS, HFB, NFT(NG)), one can posit that the relative errors of the associated two-nucleon transfer amplitudes $\alpha_0(\sim\sqrt{\sigma})$ are 4.5\%, 6.5\% and 3.5\%. In other words, spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry, a feature which is embodied in the three descriptions used (BCS, HFB, NFT(NG)) albeit, at very different levels of many-body refinement, seems to give rise to a new emergent property: a physical sum rule resulting from the intertwining of structure both in configuration- and in 3D-space (spectroscopic amplitudes and radial wavefunction) and reaction aspects of pairing in nuclei, and closely connected with the fact that $\ket{BCS}$ is a coherent state.

\section[Heavy ion reactions  and correlation length]{Heavy ion reactions between superfluid nuclei and correlation length}\label{S7.3}
One- and two- neutron transfer reactions between superfluid nuclei have been studied with magnetic and gamma spectrometers  in heavy ion reactions between superfluid nuclei\footnote{\cite{Montanari:14,Montanari:16}.},
\begin{align}\label{eq4x}
^{116}\text{Sn}+^{60}\text{Ni}\to\left\{\begin{array}{c}
^{115}\text{Sn}+^{61}\text{Ni}\quad (Q_{1n}\approx -1.74\text{ MeV}),\quad\quad\text{(a)} \\ [10pt]
^{114}\text{Sn}+^{62}\text{Ni}\quad (Q_{2n}\approx 1.307\text{ MeV}),\quad\quad\text{(b)}
\end{array} \right.
\end{align}
for twelve bombarding energies within the energy range 140.60 MeV$\leq E_{cm}\leq167.95$ MeV. That is, from energies above the Coulomb barrier ($E_B=157.60$ MeV), to well below it. The Cooper pair transfer channel (\ref{eq4x} (b)) is dominated by the ground-ground state transition, while the theoretical calculation of the differential cross section associated with channel (\ref{eq4x} (a)) indicates the incoherent contribution of a number of quasiparticle sates of $^{61}$Ni lying at energies $\lesssim 2.640$ MeV. A finding  which is consistent with the fact that the value of the pairing gap of $^{60,62}$Ni, is of the order of 1.3-1.5 MeV. That is, in the case of the reaction \ref{eq4x} (a), we are in presence of a  S-Q like transfer (see Fig. \ref{fig4.6.1}).

\end{figure}



The analysis of the data associated with the reactions (\ref{eq4x})  carried out in \cite{Montanari:14,Montanari:16} makes use of a powerful semiclassical approximation in which also the optical potential was microscopically calculated. The short wavelength of relative motion (de Broglie reduced wavelength $\lambdabar=0.36/2\pi$ fm$\approx0.06$ fm), allows to accurately determine the distance of closest approach. Making use of the $U,V$ occupation amplitudes for both Sn and Ni, as well as the optical potential given in \cite{Montanari:14}, one has calculated, within the framework of first and second order DWBA, the absolute one- and two- nucleon transfer differential cross sections.  In the second case, including both successive (dominant channel) and simultaneous transfer, properly corrected by non-orthogonality. Theory is compared with experiment in Fig. \ref{fig7.3.1}. As expected, it provides an overall account of the experimental findings\footnote{\cite{Potel:20b}\cite{Potel:20b} Potel2020.}.

As it emerges from direct inspection of Fig. \ref{fig7.3.1}, the distance of closest approach lying within the interval $13.12$ fm $\leq D_0\leq13.49$ fm, is the largest one for which $d\sigma /d\Omega|_{2n}$ is, within a factor of about 0.6 $(\approx(\pi/4)^2)$ of the same order of $d\sigma /d\Omega|_{1n}$. In keeping with Eq. (\ref{eq4.5.11}) ($v_F/c\approx0.27$, $\Delta\approx1.3-1.5$ MeV) and Eq. (\ref{eq3.2.19}) one can posit that the above interval provides a sensible bound to the size of the nuclear Cooper pair correlation length. \idx{Cooper pair!--mean square radius (correlation length)} Already increasing $D_0$ by 0.6 fm ($D_0=14.05$) $\sigma_{1n}$ becomes a factor 6 larger than $\sigma_{2n}$. A consequence  of forcing Cooper pair partners to tunnel across a barrier of ``width'' (distance of closest approach) $D\gtrsim\xi$, leading to a strain which plays a role similar to that played by the critical bias $V_{eq}\approx2\Delta/e$ (that is giving to the center of mass of the Cooper pairs a critical momentum $q\approx\hbar/\xi)$ and resulting in the rupture of the transferred Cooper pair and in the unfreezing of the quasiparticle degrees of freedom. In other words, resulting in the transition from the S-S to the S-Q transfer  regimes (Fig. \ref{fig4.6.1}). Within this context we refer to Eq. (\ref{eq3B9}) and Fig. (\ref{fig3B2}).
 
\section{The structure of ``observable'' Cooper pairs}\label{S6.5.4}
In his Waynflete lectures on Cause and Chance, Max Born\footnote{\cite{Born:48}.}, to whom we owe the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics\footnote{\cite{Born:64,Pais:86}.}, states ``\dots quantum mechanics does not describe an objective state in an independent external world, but the aspect of this world gained by considering it from a certain subjective standpoint, or with certain experimental means and arrangements''. It is within this context that we tried in previous sections to get insight concerning the structure of nuclear Cooper pairs. Specifically, in terms of two-nucleon transfer reactions. Being even more \textit{subjective} (concrete), we were interested in shedding light on the structure of one of the 5-6 Cooper pairs participating in the BCS condensate (intrinsic state in gauge space) of the Sn-isotopes (ground state rotational band\footnote{\cite{Potel:13b,Potel:17}.}) through pair transfer processes, both in light and in heavy ion reactions. That is $^{A+2}$Sn$(p,t)^{A}$Sn(gs) processes in general, and $^{120}$Sn$(p,t)^{118}$Sn in particular, as well as  $^{116}$Sn+$^{60}$Ni$\to$$^{114}$Sn+$^{62}$Ni. 


From a strict observational perspective, concerning Cooper pairs, one can only refer to the information two-nucleon transfer absolute differential cross sections carry on these entities. On the other hand, leaving out the discussion regarding the microscopic calculation of the optical potential, the carriers mediating information between structure and absolute differential cross sections, e.g. between target and outgoing particle in a standard laboratory setup, are the distorted waves. These functions can be studied independently of the transfer processes under consideration, in elastic scattering experiments. Consequently, the non-local, correlated formfactors (see Figs. \ref{fig_alpha} and \ref{fig_beta}),
\begin{align}\label{eq6.6.1}
F(\mathbf r_1,\mathbf r_2,\mathbf r_{Ap})=F_{succ}(\mathbf r_1,\mathbf r_2,\mathbf r_{Ap})+F_{sim}(\mathbf r_1,\mathbf r_2,\mathbf r_{Ap})+F_{NO}(\mathbf r_1,\mathbf r_2,\mathbf r_{Ap}),
\end{align}
sum of the corresponding functions associated with successive and simultaneous transfer  and with the non-orthogonality correction, and calculated with a variety of different sets of two-nucleon spectroscopic amplitudes (the same in each case for the three $F$-functions appearing in the rhs of Eq. (\ref{eq6.6.1})), can be compared at profit to each other. This is in keeping with the fact that they can be related, in an homogeneous fashion, with the absolute cross sections.

    \begin{figure}
    \centerline{\includegraphics*[width=9cm,angle=0]{C8/figsC8/Fig8_v2}}
    	\caption{Diagram describing structure and reaction aspects of the main process through which a Cooper pair (di-neutron) tunnels from target to projectile in the reaction $(A+2)+p\to A+t$. In order that the two--step process $(A+2)+p\to(A+1)+d\to A+t$ takes place, target and projectile have to be in contact at least in the time interval running between $t_2$ and $t_3$. During this time, the two systems create, with local regions of ever so low nucleonic presence, a common density over which the non-local pairing field can be established, and the Cooper pair can be correlated. Even with regions in which the pairing interaction may be zero. Small ellipses (with linear dimensions of the order of the nuclear radius $R_0$) indicate situations in which the two neutron correlation is distorted by the external mean field of a single of the systems involved of the reaction, i.e. $A+2$ in the entrance channel, $t$ in the exit one (see e.g. Fig. \ref{fig1F3}). The large ellipse (with linear dimensions of the order of the correlation length $\xi$) indicate the region in which the two partners of the Cooper pair correlate over distances of the order of the correlation length $\xi$. It is this information that the outgoing particle of a Cooper pair transfer process brings to the detector. In other words, this is the observable Cooper pair in terms of its specific probe, and the reason why the neutrons are described, in the interval $\Delta t=t_3-t_1$, in terms of bold face arrowed lines.}\label{fig6.5.5}
    \end{figure}
It is also of notice that the spatial dimensions, structure, non-locality and $\omega$-dependence of the function (\ref{eq6.6.1}) are expected to be rather different from those of the structure wavefunction of the Cooper pair, observed e.g. in high energy electron scattering or $(p,pn)$ reactions, a question closely connected with linear response. While this concept has been, and continues to be quite useful in the study of many-body systems, it is a subtle one. In direct two-nucleon transfer reactions induced by both light and heavy (grazing) ion  collisions, the contact between the two interacting nuclei is weak. Nonetheless, even a very low (normal) density overlap between target and projectile may induce important modifications in Cooper pairs. In particular, allow pairing correlated partner nucleons  to profit from the enlarged volume  compared to that available in the target or projectile nucleus. As a consequence the pair can  expand, each of the partner nucleons be mainly in a different nucleus, and successive become the dominant transfer mechanism. 


It can be stated that this picture is again an example of the fruitfulness of \textit{linear response} to shed light on subtle questions regarding many-body systems. In the case under discussion, it allows the partners of the nuclear Cooper pair to correlate over dimensions larger than nuclear dimensions and in so doing make their intrinsic structure ``observable'', almost free of the strong pressures of the  mean field\footnote{Within this context, one can refer to  the need of being able to distinguish between   right and left weakly coupled (dioxide-layer separated) superconductors,  to be able to measure gauge phase difference through the Josephson effect. See also \cite{Magierski:17}.}. The above discussion is schematically illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig6.5.5}. With it one comes back to the original question (Sect. \ref{S1.1}). Which are the proper variables to be used in an attempt to describe the nuclear system? Elementary modes of excitation is a valid choice. But because these modes are in interaction, the above choice is not sufficient (unique). An operative definition requires that also the specific probe, reaction or decay process is specified. In fact, if one were to study Cooper pairs through electron scattering, one would likely obtain a picture of the system as that marked by the small ellipses in Fig. \ref{fig6.5.5} (see also Fig. \ref{fig1F3}). Thus, rather different from the one  which emerges from the specific two-nucleon transfer process (large ellipse, correlation length $\xi$), as testified by the observations made as a function of the width of the Josephson-like junction (distance of closest approach) transiently established in the reaction $^{116}$Sn+$^{60}$Ni populating the \textbf{S-S} and \textbf{S-Q} channels (Sect. \ref{S7.3}).  
\section[Closing the circle]{Closing the circle\footnote{In this section we follow closely \cite{Pais:86}.}}\label{S7.6.4}
In one of the first references of this monograph\footnote{\cite{Born:26}.} entitled ``Quantum mechanics of collision phenomena'', Born considers the elastic scattering induced by a static potential, of a beam of $N$ electrons which cross a unit area per unit time, scattered by a static potential. The stationary wavefunction describing the scattering process behaves asymptotically as,
\begin{align}\label{eq7.4.2}
e^{ikz}+f(\theta,\phi)\frac{e^{kr}}{r},\quad\quad \left(k=\frac{mv}{\hbar}\right).
\end{align}
The number of particles scattered into the solid angle $d\Omega=\sin\theta d\theta d\phi$ is given by $N|f(\theta,\phi)|^2d\Omega$. To connect with Born notation one has to replace $f(\theta,\phi)$ by $\Phi_{mn}$, where $n$ denotes the initial state plane wave in the $z$--direction and $m$ the asymptotic final state in which the waves move in the direction fixed by the angles $(\theta,\phi)$. Then Born writes that $\Phi_{mn}$ determines the probability for the scattering of the electron from the $z$- to the $(\theta\phi)$-direction, adding a footnote in proof, as already mentioned, stating that a more precise consideration shows that the probability is proportional to the square of $\Phi_{mn}$. In a second paper with the same title of the first\footnote{\cite{Born:26b}.} he states explicitly that the probability is to be connected with the modulus squared\footnote{The motion of particles follows probability laws but the probability itself propagates according to the law of causality. And concerning the distinction between classical and quantal probabilities he states: ``The classical theory introduces the microscopic coordinates which determine the individual processes only to eliminate them because of ignorance by averaging over their values; whereas the new theory get the same results without introducing them at all\dots We free the forces of their classical duty of determining directly the motion of particles and allow them instead to determine the probability of states''.}. 

Within this context, the matrix element between the entrance and exit channel distorted waves of the function $F(\mathbf r_1,\mathbf r_2,\mathbf r_{Ap})$ is proportional to $f(\theta,\phi)$ and thus $\Phi_{mn}$. The function $F$ is not directly measurable, but the closer one can come of a theoretical construct connecting the Cooper pair (s+r) to experiment. For superfluid nuclei lying along the stability valley, this construct does not change much with the theory one uses to calculate the spectroscopic two--nucleon transfer amplitudes,  provided they display off diagonal long range order (ODLRO)\footnote{See footnote \ref{f37c1} Ch. \ref{introduction}. See also App. A, \cite{Potel:17} and refs. therein.}, a property closely related to phase coherence between Cooper pairs and deformation in gauge space. This is the reason why the associated absolute cross sections are rather stable, and $\alpha_0$ provides a natural order parameter to measure deformation in gauge space.


On the other hand, in the case of halo, weakly bound exotic nuclei like $^{11}$Li, the sensitivity of the absolute cross sections to the models used to calculate $F(\mathbf r_1,\mathbf r_2,\mathbf r_{Ap})$ is expected to be more relevant, and directly related to the conspicuous changes which renormalization produces in the radial shape of the single--particle wavefunctions of the halo neutrons forming the Cooper pair. This is in keeping with  the fact that the nucleus is a finite many--body system, where surface effects play a central role, and light halo weakly bound exotic nuclei like $^{11}$Be and $^{11}$Li constitute paradigms of these leptodermic controlled entities.  While the surface ($S$) to volume ($V$) ratio ($aS/V=3a/R$, $a$ being the diffusivity) is estimated to be 0.32 in the case of Sn, this value becomes 0.73 for Li.

Within this context, self-consistency in (NFT)$_{\text{ren}}$ implies both the renormalization of single-particle energies and occupancies $(\tilde\epsilon_j,Z_j(\omega))$, as well as of radial wavefunctions $(\tilde\phi(r)^{(i)})$. For each $\tilde\epsilon_j$ there can be more than one radial function, depending on whether the nucleon is moving around the ground state ($i=$gs) or an excited state ($i=$coll) of the core. In keeping with the fact that $\tilde{\phi}(r)^{(i)}$ enter in  the formfactors associated with transfer processes, self-consistency in (NFT)$_{\text{ren}}$ is intimately related to unification of (s+r). In nuclei, furthermore one has thus the unique possibility to study renormalization effects in terms of individual quantum states. Also pairing correlations resulting from bare plus induced $^1S_0$ interactions in systems with few (5-6) Cooper pairs (superfluid nuclei) down to the single Cooper pair ($^{11}$Li).
 \section{Summary}
Nucleons moving in time reversal states lying close to the Fermi energy and interacting through the  $^1S_0\;NN$-potential, and the exchange of collective vibrations (induced pairing interaction), lead to $L=0, S=0$ nuclear Cooper pairs. Making use of the two-particle wavefunction describing them, it is found that the partner nucleons come closer to each other, as compared to the uncorrelated pair situation.

Cooper pairs were introduced in physics to describe low temperature superconductivity in metals, and constitute the building blocks of BCS. The BCS ground state wavefunction describes the condensation of these weakly bound (through the exchange of virtual photons, electron plasmons and lattice phonons), widely extended (dimensions much larger than typical distances between uncorrelated electrons), strongly overlapping (quasi) bosons (pair of electrons moving in time reversal states ($\nu,\tilde \nu$) with momentum and spin ($\mathbf k\uparrow,-\mathbf k\downarrow$)).

In presence of an external field, for example that associated with the tunneling interaction of a Josephson junction --involving energies smaller than the transition temperature and thus acting on the Cooper pairs center of mass-- all pairs move  in an identical (coherent) fashion, leading to a supercurrent across the junction of carriers of charge $2e$. Its critical value  being approximately equal to the (normal) single-electron current associated with a junction bias equal to the Cooper pair binding energy ($2\Delta$) \idx{Cooper pair!binding energy}
 divided by the electron charge ($e$). A bias which imparts 
 to the center of mass of the  Cooper pairs being transferred, a momentum of the order of the inverse of the correlation length. Under such circumstances,  the back-and-forth ($\ell=0$) radial motion of electron partners (intrinsic ($\nu,\tilde \nu$) motion) cannot follow suit, getting out of step and resulting in the breaking (unbinding) of the pairs (critical current). As a consequence, supercurrent ceases and  normal current of carriers of charge $e$ starts flowing.

The traditional view of nuclear Cooper pairs described in the first paragraph of the present section, seems to be partially at odds with that found at the basis of the BCS description of low temperature superconductivity. In particular concerning insight provided by the specific probe of spontaneous breaking of conservation (of pairs) of particle number. Namely, Cooper pair tunneling across a Josephson junction.  In each of the two weakly coupled superconductors, pairs of electrons recede from each other  as compared to the normal density situation. In this way, the correlated Cooper pair partners  lower their relative kinetic energy of confinement, profiting best of the weak, attractive, (retarded) interaction. Being the electron pair phase correlated, with a correlation length much larger than the barrier thickness, although they tunnel across the junction one at a time, they do so as a single particle (of mass $2m_e$ and charge $2e$), and the probability of going through the junction is comparable to that of a single electron. It is like interference in optics, with phase coherent waves mixing.



In the transient, time-dependent, Josephson-like junction, established in a heavy ion collision between superfluid nuclei, a Cooper pair tunnels in terms of the successive transfer of two entangled nucleons. At few MeV below the Coulomb barrier, the absorptive component of the optical potential plays essentially no role in the process, and tunneling takes place lossless, free of dissipation. For such bombarding energies for which the distance of closest approach is approximately of the order, but smaller than the nuclear Cooper pair mean square radius, each partner nucleon  finds itself, in the transfer process, in a different nucleus, at a correlation length of each other. The associated probability $P_2$ of pair transfer is, under such circumstances and within a factor of two ($(\pi/4)^2$), equal to the one-neutron transfer probability $P_1$.


 For larger distances of closest approach, larger than the correlation length, the (intrinsic) back and forth relative motion  characterizing the intrinsic structure of the transferred nuclear Cooper pair gets out of step, resulting in the transition from the superfluid-superfluid (S-S) transfer regime to the superfluid-quasiparticle (S-Q) one, as testified by the fact that  $P_1$ becomes much larger than $P_2$. Already for distances of closest approach about 0.6 fm larger than the estimated (empirical) nuclear correlation length, the absolute  one-nucleon transfer cross section is about an order of magnitude larger than that associated with two-nucleon tunneling. The nuclear (S-S)$\to$(S-Q) (tunneling) phase transition as a function of the distance of closest approach, where the Cooper pair being transferred is probed (stressed) beyond the correlation length, parallels that observed in a Josephson junction, when  Cooper pairs are biased to move with a center of mass momentum of the order of the inverse of the correlation length  (of note that $\xi$ and $q$($=\hbar/\xi$) are conjugate variables).

 The gained homogeneity  between the pictures of Cooper pairs in superconductors and in nuclei is a consequence of fulfilling a basic requirement of quantum mechanics. Namely, that to specify the experimental setup in discussing a physical phenomena. In the present case one has tried to answer to the question of what the structure of a nuclear Cooper pair is when probed in terms of its specific probe, namely a probe which changes particle number in two,  comparing theory with experiment in terms of absolute cross sections.

%\section[Bootstrap mechanism to break gauge invariance]{Bootstrap particle-phonon mechanism to spontaneously break gauge invariance}\label{C8AppA}
%In this Appendix we discuss a gedankenexperiment, aimed at clarifying the bootstrap pairing mechanism resulting in the binding of the neutron halo of $^{11}$Li. 
%\subsection{Gedankenexperiment}
%Let us assume that one shines a  beam of neutrons  on a $^{9}$Li target. If these neutrons felt only the associated single-particle mean field, they will go by essentially as fast as they came in.  However,  part of the time pairs of these neutrons will bound themselves in  presence of phonon (bosonic) excitations of quadrupole and of (pygmy) dipole character, produced also by the field the two neutron create themselves. The first of these collective modes is  associated with vibrations of the  $^{9}$Li core, the second resulting from the sloshing back and forth of the strongly non-local field of two (passing by) neutrons of the beam,  against the nucleons of the core.

%	\caption{Schematic representation of the collective quadrupole and dipole response of litium isotopes, and of a ($t,p$) reaction (in the text one reasons in terms of a flux of low energy neutrons) in which two neutrons are transfered to $^9$Li.}
%\label{fig8_A_1}
%\end{figure}
%Such possibility implies that, for a short time, of the order of the traversal time, the two (unbound) neutrons will move in a gas of virtual bosonic excitations, also made out of  pygmy dipole resonances. Consequently, they can profit to be almost at threshold by moving in the $\tilde s_{1/2}$ and $\tilde p_{1/2}$ states, and to get correlated by exchanging  these bosonic collective vibrations. 
%The first phenomenon is associated, as discussed above, with phononic backflow (Pauli principle upflow) leading to $^{10}$Li-like virtual ($s-$wave) and resonant ($p-$wave) dressed single-particle states displaying parity inversion.
%The second phenomenon, mediated by phonon exchange between halo neutrons, contributes in a major way to the glue which binds the neutron halo Cooper pair to the $^{9}$Li core. Within the above scenario, one can posit that the $^{11}$Li  pygmy dipole resonance can hardly be viewed but in symbiosis with the $^9$Li halo neutron pair addition mode. The above described bootstrap phonon-exchange mechanism can be considered as a novel microscopic embodiment of the Bardeen--Pines--Fr\"{o}lich-like processes to spontaneously break gauge invariance\footnote{Bootstrapping or booting. The term is often attributed to Rudolf Erich Raspe's story \textit{The surprising Adventures of Baron M\=unchausen}, where the main character pulls himself out of a swamp by his hair. Early 19th century USA: ``pull oneself over a fence by one's bootstraps''}.
%
%
%To conclude, let us comment on Fig. \ref{fig8_A_1}. As said above, (a) the dressing of single--particle levels by collective vibrations and (b) the renormalization of the bare $NN$--interaction, in particular of the pairing interaction, through the exchange of collective modes between nucleons moving in time reversal states lying close to the Fermi energy, play a central role in nuclear structure. In particular, in the case of the single Cooper pair system $^{11}$Li, most of the glue being provided by the exchange of the  pygmy dipole resonance\footnote{Similar situations are well known in the case of isoscalar and isovector giant quadrupole resonances (see e.g. \cite{Bes:75c} and references therein).}.

\idx{Two-nucleon transfer!absolute differential cross sections (unifying structure+reactions)!computer code \textsc{cooper}}
\idx{One-particle transfer!c) computer code \textsc{one}}
%In this Appendix we provide a brief description of the numerical methods implemented in the code \textsc{coops} written to evaluate the differential cross sections. The two-nucleon transfer differential cross section is given by Eq. (\ref{eq5.1.4}),  so the principal task consists in calculating the transfer amplitudes $T^{(1)}(\theta),T^{(2)}_{succ}(\theta)$ and $T^{(2)}_{NO}(\theta)$ described in Eqs. \ref{eq1_40}-\ref{eq1_42}, by numerically evaluating the corresponding integrals.  The dimensionality of the integrals  can be reduced by expanding in partial waves (eigenfunctions of the angular momentum operator) the distorted waves and wavefunctions present in the corresponding integrands. The resulting expressions are Eqs. (\ref{eq111}) and (\ref{eq112}) for $T^{(1)}(\theta)$, Eqs. (\ref{eq27}), (\ref{eq121}) and (\ref{eq122}) for $T^{(2)}_{succ}(\theta)$, and Eqs. (\ref{eq138}), (\ref{eq139}) and (\ref{eq140}) for $T^{(2)}_{NO}(\theta)$. The integrals are computed numerically with the method of Gaussian quadratures. 
%
%
%The one-dimensional (radial) functions appearing in the integrands are defined in a spatial grid up to a given maximum radius $r_{max}$. The bound state  wavefunctions are obtained by numerical integration of the radial Schr\"odinger equation for a Woods-Saxon potential with a spin-orbit term. The parameters defining the shape of the potential are given as an input, while the depth is adjusted to reproduce the binding energy of the state under consideration. The resulting potential corresponding to the final (initial) nucleon bound state stands also for the interaction potential featured in the integrand in the prior (post) representation.
%
%
%
%
%
%
%
%The  prescription followed have been to use half of the two-neutron  separation energy as  the binding energy of the single-particle states conforming the transferred Cooper pair. When calculating the successive transfer amplitude, the energy of the Green's function of the intermediate channel $d+ (A+1)$ (see Fig. \ref{fig_beta}) is taken at the experimental energy of each of the populated states of the $(A+1)$ system. Off-shell effects due to the virtual population of the different $(A+1)$ intermediate states are thus fully taken into account. For the study of $^{11}$Li, a different approach have been followed:  the  two-neutron wavefunction have been read from a two-dimensional numerical grid, generated from the  NFT structure calculation.
% The distorted waves are obtained by integrating the radial Schr\"odinger equation with positive energy from $r=0$ to $r_{max}$, and matching the solution with the corresponding Coulomb wave function at a given $r=r_{match}$, big enough to lie outside of the range of the nuclear interaction. The  Woods-Saxon optical potentials  used to obtain the distorted waves consist on a real Coulomb term, a real and imaginary volume terms, an imaginary surface term, and a real and imaginary spin orbit terms. The parameters needed to specify all those terms are given as an input.  



In this Appendix we provide a brief description of the numerical methods implemented in the computer codes \textsc{one} and \textsc{cooper} written to evaluate the absolute differential cross sections associated with one- and two-nucleon transfer reactions.


 
 
 
 \underline{\textsc{cooper}}\footnote{\cite{Potel:12c}.}: The two-nucleon transfer differential cross section is given by Eq. (\ref{eq5.1.4}).  The principal task consists in calculating the transfer amplitudes $T^{(1)}(\theta)$, $T^{(2)}_{succ}(\theta)$ and $T^{(2)}_{NO}(\theta)$ described in Eqs. \ref{eq1_40}-\ref{eq1_42}, by numerically evaluating the corresponding integrals.  The dimensionality of the integrals  can be reduced by expanding in partial waves (eigenfunctions of the angular momentum operator) the distorted waves and wavefunctions present in the corresponding integrands. The resulting expressions are Eqs. (\ref{eq111}) and (\ref{eq112}) for $T^{(1)}(\theta)$, Eqs. (\ref{eq27}), (\ref{eq121}) and (\ref{eq122}) for $T^{(2)}_{succ}(\theta)$, and Eqs. (\ref{eq138}), (\ref{eq139}) and (\ref{eq140}) for $T^{(2)}_{NO}(\theta)$. The integrals are computed numerically with the method of Gaussian quadratures. 


The one-dimensional (radial) functions (\ref{eq7_1_2}) appearing in the integrands are defined in a spatial grid up to a given maximum radius $r_{max}$. The bound state  wavefunctions are obtained by numerical integration of the radial Schr\"odinger equation for a Woods-Saxon potential with a spin-orbit term. Along with the optical potentials governing the relative nucleus-nucleus motion in the initial, intermediate, and final channels, they conform the basic structure input needed to define the calculation. They are generated by solving a one-body Schr\"odinger equation for a Woods-Saxon with standard geometry, where the radius and diffusivity parameters are given as an input. The depth of the potential is adjusted to reproduce the binding energy of the state under consideration, according to the prescription defined below. The resulting potential corresponding to the final (initial) nucleon bound state stands also for the interaction potential featured in the integrand in the prior (post) representation. 

The binding energies of the single-particle wavefunctions  determine the asymptotic behavior of the transfer formfactors, an essential ingredient for a quantitative account of the two-nucleon transfer cross section\footnote{For an example with a simple discussion of the problem see Fig. \ref{figC7B4}.}. According to the prescription followed in the calculations discussed in the present monograph, the  orbital corresponding to the spin-parity of the  $A+1$ system will be  bound by half the experimental two-neutron separation energy $S_{2n}$   of the  $A+2$ nucleus.  The energies of the remaining single-particle states relative to the $A+1$ ground state are determined from a structure calculation. Let us illustrate this procedure with the $^{120}$Sn$(p,t)^{118}$Sn reaction with a 21 MeV proton beam. In order to assess the impact of the binding energies of the single-particle orbitals in the absolute value of the transfer cross section, we also show a calculation in which all the single-particle wavefunctions are bound with half the two-neutron separation energy of $^{120}$Sn. The binding energies used for the two calculations are collected in Table \ref{Tab7.C.1}, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. \ref{fig7.C.1}.

\underline{\textsc{one}}\footnote{\cite{Potel:12b}.}: In order to obtain the  one-particle transfer cross sections, one has to evaluate  the amplitudes defined in Eq. (\ref{eq_onept28}). The corresponding numerical integrations are   performed making use of Gaussian quadratures. The radial part of the single-particle  wavefunctions (\ref{eq_onept12}) and of the partial waves (\ref{eq_onept6}) and (\ref{eq_onept7}), are generated in the way described above. The kinetic energies defining the distorting waves in the entrance and exit channels are defined by the bombarding energy in the center of mass frame, and the experimental $Q$-value of the reaction. The binding energies corresponding to the initial and final single-particle wavefunctions are taken to be the experimental separation energy for each state. It is to note that the difference between the initial and final binding energy should be consistent with the reaction $Q$-value.  



   

\section{Statistics.}\label{App6D}
Consider two identical particles moving in a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. It is assumed  that one is in the ground state and the other  is in the first excited state. According to the superposition principle 
\begin{align}\label{eqApp6G1}
\Phi(x_1,x_2)=\lambda\phi_1(x_1)\phi_0(x_2)+\mu\phi_0(x_1)\phi_1(x_2).
\end{align} 
We calculate the correlation of these particles, that is, the quantity
\begin{align}\label{eqApp6G2}
Corr=\frac{\langle x_1x_2\rangle-\langle x_1\rangle\langle x_2\rangle}{\sqrt{\left(\langle x_1^2\rangle-\langle x_1\rangle^2\right)\left(\langle x_2^2\rangle-\langle x_2\rangle^2\right)}}
\end{align} 
Starting with
\begin{align}\label{eqApp63}
\nonumber\langle x_1x_2\rangle=&\int dx_1 dx_2 \left(\lambda^*\phi_1^*(x_1)\phi_0^*(x_2)+\mu^*\phi_0^*(x_1)\phi_1^*(x_2)\right)\\
\nonumber&\times(x_1 x_2)\left(\lambda\phi_1(x_1)\phi_0(x_2)+\mu\phi_0(x_1)\phi_1(x_2)\right)\\
\nonumber &=|\lambda|^2\langle\phi_1|x_1|\phi_1\rangle\langle\phi_0|x_2|\phi_0\rangle+\lambda^*\mu\langle\phi_1|x_1|\phi_0\rangle\langle\phi_0|x_2|\phi_1\rangle\\
&+\lambda\mu^*\langle\phi_0|x_1|\phi_1\rangle\langle\phi_1|x_2|\phi_0\rangle+|\mu|^2\langle\phi_0|x_1|\phi_0\rangle\langle\phi_1|x_2|\phi_1\rangle.
\end{align} 

In keeping with the fact that

\begin{align}\label{eqApp6G4}
\langle\phi_1|x|\phi_1\rangle=\langle\phi_0|x|\phi_0\rangle=0,
\end{align} 
and
\begin{align}\label{eqApp6G5}
\langle\phi_0|x|\phi_1\rangle=\langle\phi_1|x|\phi_0\rangle=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar\omega}{2C}},
\end{align}
one obtains
\begin{align}\label{eqApp6G6}
\langle x_1x_2\rangle=\left(\frac{\hbar\omega}{2C}\right)^2\Re(\lambda^*\mu).
\end{align} 
And 
\begin{align}\label{eqApp6G7}
\sqrt{\quad}=\left(\frac{\hbar\omega}{2C}\right)^2,
\end{align}
for the denominator of Eq. (\ref{eqApp6G2}).
From the above results the correlation function between particle 1 and 2 is
\begin{align}\label{eqApp6G8}
Corr=2\Re(\lambda^*\mu)=
\left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 1\quad (\lambda=+\mu=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})\\ 
 -1 \quad (\lambda=-\mu=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})
\end{array}
\right. 
\end{align}
It is of notice that, in quantum mechanics, average values imply the mean outcome of a large number of experiments. In this case, of the (simultaneous) measure of the position of the two particles\footnote{\cite{Basdevant:05}.}.





\section{Correlation length and generalized quantality parameter.}\label{App6H}
The correlation length can be defined as\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Annett:13} p. 62.}
\begin{align}\label{eqApp6H1}
\xi=\frac{\hbar v_F}{\pi\Delta}\approx\frac{\hbar^2}{m}\frac{k_F}{\pi\Delta},\idx{Cooper pair!--mean square radius (correlation length)}
\end{align}
where the Fermi momentum is, in the case of stable nuclei lying along the stability valley,
\begin{align}\label{eqApp6H2}
k_F\approx 1.36\,\text{fm}^{-1}.
\end{align}
Then
\begin{align}\label{eqApp6H3} 	
\xi=40\,\text{MeV fm}^2\times \frac{1.36}{\pi\Delta}\,\text{fm}^{-1}\approx \frac{17}{\Delta}\,\text{fm},
\end{align}
and,
\begin{align}\label{eqApp6H4}
\xi\approx 14\,\text{fm},\quad (\Delta\approx1.2\,\text{MeV}).
\end{align}
Thus, the associated (generalized) quantality parameter is, in the present case,
\begin{align}\label{eqApp6H8}
q_\xi=\frac{\hbar^2}{2m\xi^2}\frac{1}{2\Delta}\approx0.04.
\end{align} 
That is, the two partner nucleons are, in the Cooper pair, rigidly correlated with each other.


We now consider $^{11}_3$Li$_8$, and calculate $k_F$ (neutrons) with the help of the Thomas-Fermi model\footnote{\label{fnC655} Quantity which can be related to ($v_F/c$) according to   ($v_F/c)=\hbar k_F/(mc)=(\hbar c/(mc^2))k_F\approx0.2(k_F)\text{fm}^{-1}$). In the case in which $k_F\approx 0.8 $ fm$^{-1}$ (see Eq. (\ref{eqApp6H9})),  $v_F/c\approx 0.16$. }
\begin{align}\label{eqApp6H9}
k_F=\left(3\pi^2\frac{8}{\frac{4\pi}{3}(4.58)^3}\right)^{1/3}\,\text{fm}^{-1}\approx\frac{(18\pi)^{1/3}}{4.58}\,\text{fm}^{-1}\approx 0.8\,\text{fm}^{-1}.
\end{align} 
The correlation length can, in the present case, be calculated in terms of the correlation energy ($E_{corr}\approx-0.5$ MeV), 
\begin{align}
\xi\approx \frac{\hbar v_F}{\pi|E_{corr}|}\approx \frac{200 \text{ MeV}\times\text{fm}\times0.16}{\pi\times 0.5\text{ MeV}}\approx 20\text{ fm},
\end{align}
 the resulting generalized quantality parameter being
 \idx{Halo (single Cooper pair) nucleus $^{11}$Li!generalized quantality parameter}
\begin{align}\label{eqApp6H13}
q_\xi=\frac{\hbar^2}{2m\xi^2}\frac{1}{|E_{corr}|}\approx 0.1. \idx{Cooper pair!generalized quantality parameter}
\end{align}
It is of notice that this result is but an alternative embodiment of the relation (\ref{eq3.3.8}). One could argue that both (\ref{eq3.3.8}) and (\ref{eqApp6H13}) (as well as (\ref{eqApp6H8}) for stable nuclei), are just a manifestation of (\ref{eqApp6G8}). That there is more to it is forcefully expressed by the fact that, selecting the pure two-particle configuration $|s_{1/2}^2(0)\rangle$ ($|p_{1/2}^2(0)\rangle$) to describe the halo neutron Cooper pair of $^{11}$Li leads to absolute two--particle transfer cross sections which are about one order of magnitude larger (smaller) than the observed cross section (see Fig. \ref{fig8_1_2}). The fact that the NFT result (\ref{eq8_2_1})--(\ref{eq8_2_3}) reproduces observations within experimental errors, underscores the central role played by structure on Cooper pair tunneling, through the emergent property of generalized pairing rigidity.



Summing up, pairing correlations can modify the statistics of the elementary modes from fermionic to (quasi) bosonic ones. This takes place provided\footnote{Where $E_{intr}(q)$ stands for the energy (momentum) given to the intrinsic (center of mass) motion of the transferred Cooper pair. The quantity $D_0$ is the distance of closest approach at which the two-nucleon transfer process takes place, $\xi$ being the correlation length. Within this context see Sects. \ref{App1D} and \ref{C3AppD}. See also footnote \ref{f45C3} of Ch. \ref{chapter1}.} that $E_{intr}\ll2\Delta$, $q\ll\hbar/\xi$ and $D_0\lesssim\xi$. At the same time,  the value of the quantality parameter changes from $q\approx1$ to $q_\xi\ll 1$. That is,   from a regime of delocalized single nucleons to one of strongly overlapping, independent pair motion each being governed by the same phased wavefunction\footnote{Since $P^\dagger_\nu$ commutes for different $\nu$'s, $\ket{BCS}$ represents uncorrelated occupancy of the various pair states.} ($U'_{\nu}+V'_{\nu}e^{-2i\phi}P^\dagger_\nu)\ket{0}$, and behaving as a single entity. The operator $P^\dagger_\nu$, being a product of two fermions, do not fulfill Bose statistics ($(P^\dagger_\nu)^2=0$). This property implies the presence of a pairing gap not only for breaking a pair, but also for making a pair move differently from the others\footnote{See Eqs. (\ref{eq1.4.57}) and (\ref{eq1.4.58}).}. As a result one has (off-diagonal) long-range-order in the superfluid nuclear system \idx{Off-diagonal-long-range-order (ODLRO)}
 (ODLRO)\footnote{See footnote \ref{f37c1} Ch. \ref{introduction}.}.  This effect leads  to  generalized gauge rigidity, the detailed renormalizing and dressing mechanisms ultimately deciding on the soundness and applicability of the description under discussion. The fact that in working out the reaction mechanism one uses, for practical reasons, a single--particle basis (second order DWBA corrected by non--orthogonality), reconstructing the pair correlations in term of sums over virtual states, is at the basis of the two--neutron transfer physical sum rule discussed in Sect. \ref{S6.4.2}.
 
 The extension of the validity of the picture of superconductivity in metals based on the motion of $\approx10^{6}$ phase correlated Cooper pairs, down to few (5--8, $^{116}$Sn) and eventually  one Cooper pair ($^{11}$Li), seems short of a wonder. In particular in this last case, in which the binding of the Cooper pair is essentially due to a  quantum-mechanical many-body retarded interaction resulting from the exchange of a  collective vibration, at the edge between a soft-$E1$ mode and a Pygmy Dipole Resonance (see App. \ref{App6G}),  the associated ZPF affecting, among other things, nuclear diffusivity and the neutron skin.
 
 Within this context, the sense of wonder is common with the emergence of other unexpected quantum materials and macromolecules as a result of interactions resulting from ZPF, like the van der Waals interaction responsible, \textit{inter alia}, for the van der Waals solid made out of C$_{60}$ fullerene, as well as associated doped superconductors (Rb$_3$C$_{60}$, K$_3$C$_{60}$, Rb$_2$CsC$_{60}$, etc.)\footnote{\cite{Hebard:91,Rosseinsky:91,Holczer:91,Fleming:91,Anderson:91,Zhou:92,Hebard:92,Gunnarsson:95,Gunnarsson:97,Gunnarsson:04}, see also \cite{Broglia:04b} and refs. therein.}, let alone the Casimir interaction, and the related (weak and strong)\footnote{\cite{Chandler:02}.} hydrophobic force. Force which plays an essential role in the folding of the macromolecules responsible for metabolism\footnote{\cite{Dyson:99}.}, namely proteins (see App. \ref{C7AppG}).

Although much work has been carried out concerning multipole pairing vibrations\footnote{\label{f38C7} See \cite{Brink:05} Sect. 5.3 and refs. therein. See also  \cite{Broglia:74}, \cite{Ragnarsson:76}, \cite{Broglia:71b}, \cite{Broglia:71c}, \cite{Bes:71d}, \cite{Bes:71}, \cite{Flynn:71}, \cite{Bes:72}, \cite{Broglia:81c}, \cite{Bohr:74b}, \cite{Flynn:72},  \cite{Bortignon:76}; see also \cite{Kubo:70} and references therein.}, i.e. modes with transfer quantum numbers $\beta=\pm2$ and multipolarity and parity $\lambda^\pi$ different from $0^+$, this remains a chapter essentially missing from the subject of pairing in nuclei. Arguably, with the partial exception of quadrupole pairing studied in the multiphonon pairing vibrational spectrum\footnote{\label{f39C7} See \cite{Flynn:72}.} around the closed shell $^{208}$Pb, and in connection with strongly populated $0^+$ pairing vibrational states in the actinide region\footnote{\label{f40C7} \cite{Casten:72}, \cite{Bes:72}, \cite{Ragnarsson:76}. It is of notice that $\beta$--vibrations and monopole pairing vibrations become mixed in quadrupole deformed nuclei.}, and in  the quadrupole and hexadecapole pairing vibrations in the multiplet spectrum\footnote{\cite{Bortignon:76}.} of $^{209}$Bi.

In what follows, we  elaborate on the new insight on pairing vibrational modes, the studies of two-neutron pickup reactions on $^{11}$Li have opened. As already explained, because of the small overlap existing between halo neutrons and core nucleons both the $^1S_0$, $NN$-interaction and the symmetry-potentials become strongly screened, resulting in a subcritical value of the pairing strength and in a weak repulsion to separate protons from neutrons in the dipole channel.
As a result, neither the $J^{\pi}=0^+$ correlated neutron state  (Cooper pair), nor the $J^\pi=1^-$ one (vortex-like)\footnote{One of the effects of a vortex is that it allows rotation of a quantum system to take place about an axis of symmetry.} pair addition modes are bound 
(although both qualify to do so) to the $N=6$ closed shell system ($^{9}$Li). 




Being the bare $NN$-pairing interaction subcritical, the two neutrons can correlate their motion by exchanging vibrations of the medium in which they propagate, namely  the halo.  These modes can hardly  be the $\lambda= 2^+,3^-$ or $5^-$ surface vibrations found in nuclei lying along the  stability valley. This is because the diffusivity of the halo is consistent, and it blurs the very definition of surface. It is of notice that those associated with  the core ($ 2^+$ see Fig. \ref{fig6.I.1} (c), and eventually also $3^-,5^-$ etc.) provide some glue, but insufficient to bind  the  halo dineutron system.

As already mentioned, the next alternative is that of bootstrapping. \idx{Halo (single Cooper pair) nucleus $^{11}$Li!symbiotic (bootstrap) mechanism to break gauge invariance}
 Namely, that in which the two partners of the  (monopole) Cooper pair exchange  pairs of vortices 
(dipole Cooper pair),  as well as one dipole Cooper pair and a quadrupole pair removal mode,
while those of the vortex exchange  pairs of Coopers pairs (monopole pairing vibrations), but also two dipole pairs, as shown in Figs. \ref{fig6.I.1} and \ref{fig6.I.2}.  In other words, by  liaising  with each other,  
the two dineutrons contenders at the role of $^{11}$Li ground state  settle the issue.  As a result  the Cooper pair becomes weakly bound ($S_{2n}$ = 380 keV), the vortex state remaining barely unbound, $\approx$0.7-0.8 MeV above the bound Cooper pair and thus few hundreds keV above threshold.
There is, in principle, no physical reason why things could not have gone  the other way. Within this context we refer to $^3$He superfluidity, where condensation involve $S=1$ pairs. It is of notice that we are not considering spin degrees of freedom in  the present case,
at least  not dynamic ones. 

For practical purposes, one can describe the  $1^-$ as a two quasiparticle state and calculate it within  the framework of QRPA\footnote{\cite{Broglia:19}.},  including the $p-h$, $p-p$ and $h-h$ channels and adjusting the strength of the dipole-dipole separable interaction to reproduce the  experimental findings (Fig. \ref{fig3.8.1}). In this basis it is referred to  as a Pygmy Dipole  Resonance (PDR)\footnote{\cite{Barranco:01,Broglia:19c}.}. Exchanged between the  two partners of the Cooper pair (Fig. \ref{fig6.I.1}(d)) leads to essentially the right value of  dineutron binding  to the $^9$Li core. Within this context  one can view the
$^{11}$Li neutron halo as a van der Waals Cooper pair \idx{Cooper pair!van der Waals}
 (Fig. \ref{fig6.I.1} (\textbf{e}); see also Sect. \ref{C2SG2}). The transformation between this picture and  that discussed in connection with 
(\textbf{a}) and (\textbf{b}) as well as with Fig. \ref{fig6.I.2} can be obtained  expressing the PDR, QRPA wavefunction, in terms of particle  creation and destruction operators (Bogoliubov-Valatin transformation) as seen from Fig. \ref{fig6.I.1} (\textbf{a}) and (\textbf{b}). 
A vortex-vortex  stabilised Cooper pair emerges. 

Which of the two  pictures is more adequate to describe  the dipole mediated condensation is an open question,  
as each of them reflects  important physical properties which   characterise  the PDR. In any case, both indicate the symbiotic character  of the halo Cooper pair  addition mode  and of the pygmy dipole resonance  built on top of, and almost degenerate with it. 
Insight into this question can be obtained  by shedding light on the question  of whether  the velocity field of each of the symbiotic  states is more similar  to that associated  with irrotational or vortex-like flow\footnote{See \cite{Repko:13}. Within this context, and making use of an analogy, one can  mention that a consistent description of the GQR and of the GIQR is obtained 
assuming that the average eccentricity of neutron orbits 
is equal to the average eccentricity of the proton orbits (\cite{Bes:75c}), the scenario of neutron skin.
The  isoscalar quadrupole-quadrupole interaction is attractive. Furthermore, 
the valence orbitals of nuclei have, as a rule and aside from intruder states, homogeneous parity. These facts  preclude 
the GQR to play the role of the PDR. In fact, there will always be a low--lying quadrupole vibration closely 
connected with the aligned coupling scheme and thus  with nuclear plasticity. Within this context one can  nonetheless  posit  that the GQR, related to neutron skin,  is closely associated with the aligned coupling scheme.
Making a parallel, one can posit  that the PDR is closely connected with vortical motion. 
Arguably,  support for this picture is provided by the   low-lying  E1 
strength of $^{11}$Li. It  results from the presence of $s_{1/2}$ and $p_{1/2}$ orbitals almost degenerate and at threshold, 
leading to a low-lying Cooper pair coupled to angular momentum $1^-$. (dipole pair addition mode). 
The  scenario of vortical motion. }. Two-nucleon transfer reactions, specific probe  of (multipole) pairing vibrational modes, contain many of the answers to the above question (Fig. \ref{fig6.I.3}), to the extent that one is able, as one is, to calculate absolute differential cross sections within \%10 accuracy.
In fact,  ground state correlations will play a very different role in the absolute value of the $^9$Li(t,p)$^{11}$Li ($1^-$) cross section,
depending  on which picture is correct. In the case in which 
it can be 
 viewed as a vortex (pair addition dipole mode) it will lead to an increase of the two-particle transfer reaction 
 (positive coherence).
 It will  produce the opposite effect if the correct interpretation of the PDR   is that of a 
more ($p-h$)-like excitation\footnote{ \cite{Broglia:71}.}. 
Insight  in the above question may also be obtained by studying  the properties of
a quantal vortex in a Wigner cell with parameters which approximately reproduce 
the halo of $^{11}$Li. Within this context, and  for the solely purpose of providing an analogy, we refer 
to what have been  done in the study of quantal vortices in the environment of neutron stars\footnote{\cite{Avogadro:07,Avogadro:08}.}.


A  possible test of the soundness of the physics  discussed above, concerns the question of whether the first excited, 
$0^+$ halo state ($E_x$= 2.24 MeV) of $^{12}$Be can be viewed as the $|$gs($^{11}$Li$)\rangle$ in a new environment. In other words, 
to consider the halo neutron pair addition mode
 a novel mode of  elementary excitation: neutron halo pair  addition mode of which the $|1^- $($^{12}$Be) ; 2.71 MeV$\rangle $ is 
 a fraction of  its symbiotic  PDR partner. One can gain insight concerning this question, by 
 eventually measuring the E1-branching ratio $|1^-$ (2.71 MeV)$\rangle  \to |0^+$* (2.24 MeV)$\rangle$ ), and possibly 
 finding other low-energy E1-transitions populating the $0^*$ state, as well as through  two-nucleon stripping process,
 and two-nucleon pickup and knockout reactions (Fig. \ref{fig6.I.4}).
 A resum\'e of the picture discussed above is given   in Fig. \ref{fig3.8.1}. 
 \section[Vacuum fluctuations: the Casimir effect]{Vacuum fluctuations and interactions: the Casimir effect}\label{C7AppG}
In Fig. \ref{fig6G1} (I) (a) an example is given of  zero-point fluctuations (ZPF) of the nuclear vacuum (ground state) in which, a surface quantised vibration and an uncorrelated particle--hole mode get virtually excited for a short period of time.  Adding 
a nucleon (odd system, Fig. \ref{fig6G1} (I) (b)) leads, through the particle--vibration coupling mechanism to processes which contain the effect of the antisymmetry between the single-particle explicitly considered and the particles out of which  the vibrations are built  (Fig. \ref{fig6G1} (I)(c)). Time ordering 
gives rise to the graph shown in Fig. \ref{fig6G1} (I)(d). Processes I(c) and I(d),  known as correlation (CO) and polarisation (PO) contributions to the mass
operator,  dress the particles and lead to physical nucleons  whose properties can be compared with the experimental findings with the help of specific experimental probes. For example one--particle transfer reactions. Summing up, 
the processes shown in Fig. \ref{fig6G1} (I) are examples of quantum field theory phenomena. They testify  to the fact that the dressing of nucleons is at the basis of the quantal description of the atomic nucleus. 

Nuclear superfluidity at large, and its incipience in the case of single Cooper pair like e.g. in $^{11}$Li in particular, are among the most quantal of all  the phenomena displayed by the nuclear many-body 
system. Even if the bare $^1S_0$, $NN-$interaction was not operative, or was rendered subcritical by screening effects as in the case of $^{11}$Li, Cooper binding will still be possible, as a result of the exchange of vibrations between pairs of physical (dressed) nucleons (Fig. \ref{fig6G1} (II) (a), (c)) moving in time reversal states close to the Fermi energy (Fig. \ref{fig6G1} (II)(b),(d)-(g)). This is a
consequence of the ZPF associated with the  nuclear vacuum (ground) state. \textit{Arrived at this point, the reader may find it useful to read again Sect. \ref{S1.9}, in particular the last paragraphs.}

\caption{Casimir effect. Two metallic isolated, conducting plates (grey vertical sections) in vacuum attract
each other when they are placed at very small distances (of the order of micron). This is known as the
Casimir effect. The origin of such a force can be traced back to quantal zero point fluctuations (ZPF) of the electromagnetic vacuum. In
the figure a cartoon of such processes is given. Virtual electrons ($e^-$, solid dots) and positrons ($e^+$ , open
dots) pop up of the vacuum together with a photon, and travel for short distances and times. In their
way, some of them hit the plates. Because the range of wavelengths allowed between
the plates is smaller than the full spectrum allowed for
the photons associated with the electromagnetic ZPF in the right and left unlimited halves, more fermions
or bosons will be knocking the plates from outside than from the in between region, thus leading to an imbalance of
the ``quantal'' pressure and consequently to an effective attractive force.}\label{fig6G3}
\end{figure}
The many-body character of the attractive interaction between nucleons arising from the nuclear (vacuum) ZPF discussed above, and important to describe phenomena occurring close to the surface of the Fermi sea, have a classical analogue. Fittingly, a classical phenomenon which emerges from maritime experience. 


At sea, on a windless day in which the water surface can resemble a mirror, free floating
ships singly or in groups do not do much, just stay put. The situation is quite different
in a strong swell, still on a windless situation. In this case, single, isolated ships end up
lying parallel to the wave crests (see Fig.\ref{fig6G2}(a)) and start rolling heavily. In the days
of the clipper ships it was believed that under those circumstances, two vessels at close
distance, attracted each other. This in keeping with the fact that the rigs of the rolling
ships became often entangled leading to disaster. It was not until quite recently\footnote{\cite{Boersma:96}.}
that a quantitative understanding of the phenomenon (based on knowledge of similar quantal
effects) was achieved, providing evidence that the old tale was true.
Only waves with wavelength smaller or equal than the separation of the ships can exist between
them. In the region of sea extending away from the ships to the horizon, waves of any
wavelength can exist (see Fig. \ref{fig6G2}(b)). This fact results into an imbalance between the
forces excerted by the internal (between ships) waves, in favour of that excerted by the
external waves, leading to a net attraction.
Quantum mechanical, such an effect is known as the Casimir effect\footnote{\cite{Casimir:48}.}. 


Two conducting,
neutral plates at very small distances, of the order of the micron (1$\mu$ = $10^{-6}$ m), attract each
other, due to the imbalance in electromagnetic field pressure exerted by the bombarding
of  the surface by photons, electrons and positrons, arising from the ZPF of the electromagnetic field\footnote{As stated in the last sentences of the caption to Fig. \ref{fig6G3}, long wavelengths play the central role in the Casimir effect. A recurring property of the modes renormalizing the bare interaction or the associated collective variables (elementary modes of excitation) found in condensed matter (phonons of much lower frequency ($\omega_{ip}$) than plasmons ($\omega_{ep}$), nuclei (collective quadrupole and soft-$E_1$ (pygmy) modes ($\hbar\omega_2$, $\hbar\omega_{PDR})\ll\hbar\omega_{GR}$), proteins (in this connection see \cite{Micheletti:04,Micheletti:01,Micheletti:02,Hamacher:10}; see also footnote \ref{f52C1} of Ch. \ref{introduction}).}
(see Fig. \ref{fig6G3}). It is of notice that the Casimir effect, namely the attraction between two metallic,
uncharged, plates which in Fig. \ref{fig6G3} have been drawn  as plane surfaces, can in
principle have any shape. 

\emph{Summing up, in a similar way in which one can state that there are neither bare fermions (e.g. electrons or nucleons) nor bare  bosons (or quasi-bosons) (e.g. photons or surface vibrations),  one can posit that essentially all  bare
forces are, with varied degrees of complexity and strength, renormalized 
by many-body effects. This message comes also from  the least suspected of all fundamental forces, the Coulomb interaction, responsible for all of chemistry and most of of biophysics (see also  Sect. \ref{App3A3}).}
\subsection{The hydrophobic force}
Water has three noteworthy properties: liquid water is heavier than ice, it has an exceptionally large specific heat\footnote{Water absorbs  at 25 $^\circ$C, 4.18 Joules/(g K) of heat when the temperature of one gram is increased 1 degree celsius ($^\circ$C). For the sake of comparison, it takes $\approx 2.0$ Joules/(g K) of heat to raise 1 gram of acetic acid, acetone or ethanol 1 $^\circ$C.} --the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 kg of mass 1 degree Kelvin at room temperature ($\approx$300 K)-- aside from being an excellent solvent due to its dipole moment.


All these properties follow from the structure of the water molecule H$_2$O. This, in turn, is connected with the directional, anisotropic structure of the valence, electronic distribution of O. Oxygen is an open shell atom\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Greiner:98}.}, having in its ground state only four electrons in the last occupied $2p$--orbital which can host six ($\ket{gs}=\ket{1s^2}\ket{2s^2}\ket{2p^4}$). It can thus use at profit the electrons of the two H--atoms to dynamically become a closed shell system ($^{20}$Ne--noble gas--like electronic configuration, Fig. \ref{fig6G5} (c)). 
\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=13cm]{C8/figsC8/fig6G5.pdf}}
\caption{(\textbf{a}) To understand the behavior of water molecules one has to realize that in the covalent bonds, where the oxygen and the hydrogen atoms share a couple of electrons, the corresponding electronic cloud is somewhat more concentrated on the oxygen than on the hydrogen. The oxygen acquires a partial charge $-2\delta$ while each hydrogen gets a positive one $+\delta$. (\textbf{b}) Such charges give rise to an attractive electric force between  close lying molecules, in which the hydrogen atoms of a molecule points to the oxygen atom of the other molecule. One can view this attractive force as a type of chemical bond. It is known as hydrogen bond (dotted line). It is of notice that also in this type of bond there is a component which implies the sharing of electrons. Furthermore, the hydrogen atom in an hydrogen bond does not just stick indiscriminantly to the  oxygen of another molecule. Being positively charged it goes where the electrons are. So the hydrogen bond is a bond between a hydrogen atom and a lone pair (two solid dots) its length $\ell$ being 1.83 \AA, while $\ell'=1.04$ \AA. This means that a water molecule can form four hydrogen bonds: the molecule's two hydrogens form two bonds with neighboring oxygens, while the molecule's two lone pairs interact with neighboring hydrogens. (\textbf{c}) Schematic electronic structure of H$_2$O is displayed below (b) to schematically indicate the origin of the lone pair of electrons, as well as the role the electrons of the two hydrogen atoms have in closing the $2p$-shell of the oxygen atom.}\label{fig6G5}

Hybridization between the four orbitals $\ket{2s}$ $,\ket{2p_x},\ket{2p_y}$ and $\ket{2p_z}$  leads to a tetrahedral correlation in which the four orbitals $\ket{i}$ point towards the corners of a tetrahedron with the oxygen atom at the center (Fig. \ref{fig6G5} (a), \ref{fig6G6}). Because the electronic distribution has its charge center closer to the oxygen atom than to the two protons of the H--atoms, H$_2$O has a sizable dipole moment\footnote{The dipole moment of a polar molecule is defined as $u=ql$, where $l$ is the distance between the two charges $+q$ and $-q$. Thus, for two electronic charges $q=\pm e$ separated by $l=0.1$ nm, the dipole moment is $u=1.602\times 10^{-19}$ C$\times10^{-10}$ m=4.8 D, where the Debye=1D=3.336$\times10^{-30}$ Cm is the unit of dipole moment (C stands for Coulomb and m for meters). Small polar molecules have moments of the order of 1D (see e.g. \cite{Israelachvili:85}).} ($\approx 0.68 ea_0\approx0.6$ D, $e$ being the electron charge, $a_0$ the Bohr radius and D the Debye unit). Water molecules can form four hydrogen bonds\footnote{Let us consider an H atom in a covalent bond with oxygen. When a second oxygen atom approaches the H atom, its nucleus, the proton, sees a potential with two minima, and tunnels through the corresponding barrier from one minimum to the other. In other words, the effective potential in which the proton moves becomes broader as compared to the single oxygen potential. Thus, the quantum mechanical confinement kinetic energy decreases by roughly a factor of two. This implies that the order of magnitude energy of an hydrogen bond between two oxygen atoms corresponds to the difference in the corresponding ZPF energies, i.e. $\approx200$ meV ($\approx 0.38$ eV-0.19 eV$\approx$ 0.2 eV$\approx$ 4.6 kcal/mol ($\approx8$ kT), where kT ($\approx0.6$ kcal/mol$\approx25$ meV) is the thermal energy at room temperature ($\approx300$ K)). For comparison a covalent  bond corresponds to $\approx96$ kcal/mol$\approx4$ eV, while the van der Waals interaction energy between two H (Eqs. (\ref{eq2.D.18}) and (\ref{eq2.D.19})) at a distance of 2.4 \AA, that is of the order of the hydrogen bond length of 1.83 \AA,  is $\approx20$ meV (see \cite{Povh:02})} (hb; see also Fig. \ref{fig6G7}) a special bond between molecules which is produced in situations when they share an hydrogen nucleus between them. The molecule's two hydrogen atoms form two bonds with neighboring oxygens, while the molecule's two lone pairs interact with neighboring hydrogens\footnote{A possible pedestrian explanation of this is to impersonate a water molecule. Quoting from \cite{Ball:03}: ``Your hands are hydrogen atoms, your ankles are the lone pairs of electrons of oxygen. Stand legs apart\dots Twist 90$^\circ$ at the waist, stretch your arms and you're H$_2$O. The way that water molecules join up has just one rule: hands can grab ankles, but nothing else. That grasp is an hydrogen bond''.} (Figs. \ref{fig6G5} (b) and \ref{fig6G7}). 


Water and oil do not mix. The term hydrophobic (water-fearing) is commonly used to describe substances that, like oil, do not mix (dissolves) with (in) water. Although it may look as if water repels oil, these two types of molecules actually attract each other, e.g. through the van der Waals interaction, but not nearly as strongly as water attracts itself. Mixing enough oil (hydrophobic, non polar (NP) molecules) with water leads to a reduction in favorable bonding. Strong mutual attraction between water molecules induce segregation of NP molecules from water and results in an effective NP-NP (hydrophobic) attraction, as observed  in surface force measurements\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Chandler:02,Chandler:05} and \cite{Lum:99} and references therein.}. The loss of hydrogen bonds near the two extended hydrophobic surfaces depicted in Fig. \ref{fig6G8} causes water to move away from those surfaces\footnote{Hydrophobic molecules do not hydrogen bond to water, creating excluded regions where the density of water molecules vanishes. When these units are small enough, water can reorganize near them without loosing hydrogen bonds, building an ice--like cage around the NP molecule. The entropic cost of this structural change leads to low solubility for small apolar molecules in water. Said it differently, such a force, known as the weak hydrophobic force (WHI) leads only to metastable states of groups of nonpolar molecules (\cite{Chandler:02}). On the other hand, close to a large hydrophobic object (Fig. \ref{fig6G8}), the persistence of an hydrogen bond network --four bond per water molecule-- cannot persist, being geometrically impossible. In this case, water molecules near the hydrophobic cluster (surface) have typically three or fewer hydrogen bonds. This force, known as the strong hydrophobic force (SHI, \cite{Chandler:02}) can be viewed as a \textit{bona fide} hydrophobic interaction, stabilizing large aggregates of nonpolar molecules.}, producing thin vapour layers. Fluctuations in the interfaces formed in this way can destabilize and expel the remaining liquid contained between these surfaces. The resulting pressure imbalance will cause the surfaces to attract. If the liquid is close to coexistence with the vapor phase, as is the case for water at ambient (biological) conditions\footnote{In particular at $T\approx300$K($\approx 27$C$^\circ$). This is the reason why proteins unfold at low temperatures, in particular the monomer of the HIV-1-protease homodimer, which denaturizes at 8C$^\circ$ (\cite{Rosner:17}). In general this temperature lies below freezing point and one has to use particular techniques to be able to deal with supercool water (e.g. capilars, etc.).}, this phenomenon occurs also for widely separated surfaces. The similarity with a (generalized) Casimir effect is apparent. 


Within this context, and in keeping with the fact that the hydrophobic force plays a central role in the folding and, as a consequence, in the biological activity of proteins, one can point that water at physiological conditions ($T=$300K, pH=7, etc.) can be viewed as the vacuum of the macromolecules responsible for metabolism, and thus one of the two origins of life on earth\footnote{To the question ``what is life?'' (\cite{Schrodinger:44}) one is forced to answer that life is not one but two things (\cite{Dyson:99}). Which ones? Replication and metabolism. The molecules of DNA and RNA are responsible for the first function (\cite{Watson:53,Watson:80}), proteins (i.e. polymers made out of the 20 commonly occurring amino acids in nature), for the second (\cite{Sanger:52}). Because software (replication) is necessary a parasite of hardware (proteins), the becoming of a protein carries, to a large extent, the secret of life (\cite{Monod:70}).}.


While the many-body basis of hydrophobicity cannot be denied (Fig. \ref{fig6G7}) the parallel with the zero-body Casimir effect (Fig. \ref{fig6G3}) can hardly be avoided. Neither with the nuclear phenomena  discussed in Sect. \ref{C3AppEx} in connection with superconductivity  in nuclei and in metals (see also Sect. \ref{App1AF} concerning pairing in $^{11}$Li).

Within this scenario, one can also observe a (generalized) Nambu-tumbling effect. Namely  the chain \textit{hydrogen bond$\to$ weak and strong hydrophobicity $\to$ polypeptide chain evolution$\to$ proteins (second order phase transition, spontaneous symmetry breaking in information space\footnote{\cite{Broglia:13b}.})$\to$ protein folding (first order phase transition in conformation space)$\to$ metabolism}. And, at the basis of the first link of the chain,  one finds the difference in the ZPF energy which an hydrogen nucleus feels when in presence of one (O) or two (O$_2$) oxygen nuclei, quantity closely connected with quantum fluctuation of confinement (\cite{Povh:02}).
