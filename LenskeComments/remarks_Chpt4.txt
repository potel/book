Chpt.4:
That's a highly valuable connection to nculear reactions and solid state physics and many worked out mathematical/theoretical relations!
- check Fig. 4.1.1 and 4.1.2: the formulas deserve a better presentation. Why not including them into the text together 
  with the extended explanantion in the captions?
- Fig. 4.1.3: a noisy figure, also becasue the sub-labels a), b) etc. appear to be distributed randomly
- Fig. 4.2.2: a bit faint. (A much more impressive presentation is to use liaer scael and dispaly r^2*rhor)
- p. 273, center: why "2\xi\approx 30 fm" at this location? 
- p. 277/4. line: PDR = Pygmy Dipole Resonance
- nice "Sokratesian" presentation of the pros and contras in sect. 4.4 
- sect. 4.5: see my previous remarks on the danger of "trivializing the OMP". The dispersion relation technique is powerful in principle 
  but requires the knowledge of the full energy (and momentum) dependence of either the real or the imaginary part in order to be a tool 
  beyond a plane recepy
- Fig. 4.8.1: much too busy and hampered by combining various styles! Split and clean it up.
- Fig. 4.B.3: oversized
- p. 335: misaligned formula in 1. pargraph of sect. 4.B.3
- p. 346: Start the headline with a capital letter
