Intro
1. Eq.(1.1.9): spend a few words on the classical LD-picture and the quantization (maybe by ref. to BM)
2. Fig.1.1.1: explain the dashed lines, shown in the inset; explain the doube-parabola
3. Fig.1.1.3 & 1.1.4: poor quality
4. p.20: unclear sentences:
   - "This behaviour is to be found..." that sentence mixes up a variety of pnenomena whhci better should be discussed in sperate sentences
   - "...which change in one unit.." the same is true for this sentence. 
     Such highly condensed statements appear repeatedly also at other isntances of the text. For those readers using the book as an 
     introductory textg to and /or a study text for nuclear theory, this might pose a severe problems.
5. Eq.(1.2.3) etc. : explain kappa, explain $\hat{\alpha}$
6. Eq.(1.2.6): point out that the proper in-medium interaction has to be used to. e.g. v=v(\vec{x},\rho)
7. Fig. 1.2.1: poor quality
8. Footnote: RPA sums the bubble or ring diagrams (Fig. 1.2.3), ladder diagrams are contributing to fig.1.2.2     
9. Fig. 1.2.2: left column is of poor quality; what is the rational to show (3) and /4) in additon to (1b) and (2)?; 
   (8) might be attached to (5) and (6); the phrase "bare NN-interaction" is misleading: I guess, it's the ladder-summed (Breuckner) 
   in-medium interaction what is meant
10. Caption Fig.(1.2.3): The equations (Y, 1/kappa) deserve a deeper discussions in the text
11. Fig.1.3.1: the appearance of bold "=" and "+" and $\Sigma$ disatracts the reader form the true content, namely the  diagrams.
12. Eq.(1.3.4)Ö: a coupling constatn might be in place.
13. Fig.(1.3.2): very busy figure, many new and unexplained symbols and notations, e.g. what is $\sigma$, what is meant by the various "Q"'s? 
    Someone who is not yet an expert, might get lost. As a rule: Help the potential reader, otherwise people may give up reading the book!
14. p. 30: The phrase "...is thus gauge invariant." might be controversial in it's generality and therefore should be explained in view of that 
    QFT/QED-people have a diffferent understanding of gauge invariance, so do our friends from chiral EFT etc.  
15. Eq.(1.8.4): although the notation a^\dag(\vec r) is used frequently, I'd prefer the QFT notation \psi(\vec r) as used in many other 
    text books of quantum many-body theory - but that mighrt be a matter of personal taste
16. p.50, First paragraph: it migth be mentioned that m_\omega is related to the (energy-)slope of the dispersive self-energy 
17. Eq.(1.8.7) adn (1.8.8): definition of R_{v_i}(r)?
18. A conclusion on Chpt.1: many interesting and important topics are addressed but the rather condensed presentation might 
    bring the non-expert reader to a feeling of "getting lost". Many of the NFT aspects, you are discussing later 
    anyway in due detail, so there is no urgent need to "squeeze" them into the introduction. As I wrote before, it might be more helpful 
    to the reader to spending instead more space on the origin and structure of NN-interactions in the nuclear medium and how they lead to 
    self-binding and other cooperative dynamical effects in nuclei.




































  Chpt.2:

1. p.67: the last paragraph, "An essential test..." is hardly understandable, 
   esp. the second sentence seems to be a fragment, the same for ""Coupligns which are.."
2. As a general reamrk: in many cases the figure captions are quite extensive, containing 
   important material whcih would better be discussed in the running text.
3. Fig.(2.4.1): much to busy!! No one will understand the meaning of all the lines, coming without labelling.
   Is that fig. really needed?
4. Fig.(2.4.2): the lines are a bit faint.
5. Sect. 2.7.4: Mayn of the figure are of bad quality - maybe it's a probelms of the proof printing?
6. Sect.2.9.2 is in danger to "trivialize" the optical potential problem. I'd suggest to refer to te vast literature on that subject, 
   ew.g. the books of Satchler, Feshbach, Hogdson and the reviews of Mahaux et al.   
7. p. 134: You should reconsider that busy figure: It is worth at least 5 separate figures and the the eqautions must be 
   discussed in the runnign text. That figure migth work in a talk where you lead by discussion the audience through the
   displayed material. But it's horrible in printed form, probably mainly due to the reduction from screen to page format.  
8. p.135/136: the numbering looks a bit odd - spend a period to the numbers, i.e. use 1. 2. 3.  
9. Fig(2.9.2) -> see remarks 2. and 7.
10. Fig,(2.9.3), upper part -> see remarks 2 . and 7.  
11. Fig.(2.9.4) -> see remark 2.
12. Fig.(2.9.5) -> see remark 2.
13. Fig.(2.10.1) another very busy figure which would deserve disassembling into a couple of separate figures. 
    I uderstand the intention to illustrated the interpay of various observables but is that also obvious to a 
    broader readership?
14. Conclusions on Chpt.2: Overall, it's well done, also the material in the appendices! The connection of microscopic aspects of nuclear many-body dynamics and nuclear phenomenology is elucidated
    by NFT. Why don't you start the chapter with intriducing NFT in the first place? I'd consider such a rearrangemnt an 
    interesting alternative, putting more weight on "hard" many-body theory.  





Chpt. 3:
Overall, I like this chapter very much!
- Fig. 3.2.15 exceeds the layout of the text width
- Fig. 3.3.1  check the text-inlay and caption:  q meany Q? Mis-adjustment of "a~"
- a general remark: mean field (your use) or mean-field (widely used in the literature)?
- Fig. 3.4.1.: bad quality - at least in the proof copy
- why do you change to small initial letters in subsections 3.4.1/3.4.2
- Fig. 3.4.2.: another example for a figure which works well as a transpareny but may put the reader in despair when printed
- Fig. 3.5.2/ 3.5.3 and 3.5.4/3.5.5: why are you using different layouts (small vs. bold lines) for the two diagrams? It might be even better to combine the two graphs into one figure 
- title of sect. 3.6: "Halo pair addition mode and pygmy:..." the left alone "pygmy" reads like a fragment of a sentence waiting for completion
- "clothed" is a bit unusual compared, main use is "dressed"
- Fig. 3.A.1 comes around a bit overcrowded and exceeds the text layout
- check type-setting of "^9LI(t,p)..." on p. 229
- the hand-drawn diagrams in the App. 3.D are artful but fall out of the scheme of the book


























Chpt.4:
That's a highly valuable connection to nculear reactions and solid state physics and many worked out mathematical/theoretical relations!
- check Fig. 4.1.1 and 4.1.2: the formulas deserve a better presentation. Why not including them into the text together 
  with the extended explanantion in the captions?
- Fig. 4.1.3: a noisy figure, also becasue the sub-labels a), b) etc. appear to be distributed randomly
- Fig. 4.2.2: a bit faint. (A much more impressive presentation is to use liaer scael and dispaly r^2*rhor)
- p. 273, center: why "2\xi\approx 30 fm" at this location? 
- p. 277/4. line: PDR = Pygmy Dipole Resonance
- nice "Sokratesian" presentation of the pros and contras in sect. 4.4 
- sect. 4.5: see my previous remarks on the danger of "trivializing the OMP". The dispersion relation technique is powerful in principle 
  but requires the knowledge of the full energy (and momentum) dependence of either the real or the imaginary part in order to be a tool 
  beyond a plane recepy
- Fig. 4.8.1: much too busy and hampered by combining various styles! Split and clean it up.
- Fig. 4.B.3: oversized
- p. 335: misaligned formula in 1. pargraph of sect. 4.B.3
- p. 346: Start the headline with a capital letter
























  Chpt. 5:
This chapter, together with chpt. 6, are covering an impressive amount of material! It will be of high value 
for everybody who is working actively on the theory of transfer reactions and the practical-numerical appliccations thereof.
Especially the very detailed discussionsin the appendices will be a big help for advanced students and experienced researchers. I like very much 
that you consider the wave functions of the transferred particles as entities, refraining from introducing the artificial concept of spectroscopic 
factors as independent quantities. 

Maybe I missed it: Reference to the book of Feshbach (Vol.2 Reaction Theory) might be added. Historically,
Tamura did a lot of fundamental work on the theory transfer reactions, esp. addressing and solving the non-orthogonality and non-locality 
problems of single and multiple particle transfer with complex projectiles. There are (at least) two Phys.Rept.'s from the 1970ies by
Tamura on these issues, as you might remember from your collaboration with him.
  

- p.362; misaligned formula
- Fig. 5.2.2: missing labels on all axes
- Fig. 5.H.1; misaligned, exceeds the page layout. Also, that figure is positioned in the references.



















Chpt. 6:
The general (enthusiastic) remarks in remarks on Chpt. 5 apply also to this chpater. The workout of 2nd order DWBA is 
highly appreciable. Both chapters together qualify in fact for a separate monograph!

- Eqs. 6.1.2 & 6.1.3.: Why do you introduce the A+2 particle wave fucntion as a Wood-Saxon eigenfunction already so early? 
At this point, wouldn't it be enough to say that it is defined as an overlap wave function and s such a matter of nuclear structure theory? 
If desired, one may certainly add that in practical calculations a widely used approach is to use W-S eigenfucntions. In genreal (later parts of that chapter), I'd refer to 
the W-S wave functions as part of the "practioneer's tool box".
- p. 427, 1st pargraph: check the defintion/decomposition of the triton wave function. The use of the same symbol (rho) for 
quite different objects is a bit misleading.  
- in App. 6.D, App. 6.E; and App. 6.F:  titles are printed by small letters, different from the use before and after,
- App. 6.H: the title is misaligned  




























Chpt. 7:
i like very much the applications to the halo systems. That aspect is worth to be put into the foreground in the introductory 
paragraph instead of the "software" issue (sse below). On the other hand, a brief introduction of the standard codes for numerical simulations of
nuclear structure and reaCtion problems and where to find them would be of great help for the reader.

- To me, the title looks like a fragment. Wouldn't it be better to choose a title "Structure Studies with Transfer Reactions" or 
"Transfer Reactions as Nuclear Structure Probes" or "Probing Nuclear Structure by Transfer Reactions"?
- The message of the very first sentence is unclear: What do you "with the help of software"? To me, one way of understanding is that you're 
  going to introduce computer codes (and make them available to the reader). However, a look into sect. 7.C shows that you are "only" giving a 
  conceptual description of a numerical scheme. Also, what means "see App. 7.C cooper, one"?
- Anyway, I'd use "computer codes", rather than the unspecific word "software".
- p.491, first line in sect. 7.1, misaligned 
- Fig. 7.1.2 is washed put, needs "sharpening"
- Fig. 7.1.3 exceeds the page layout. If reduced the text (configurations) in the two lower boxes might be hardyl readable
- Tabs. 7.1.1 and 7.4.2 are misaligned
- The titles of sects. 7.1.1 and 7.1.2 are looking a bit lost: "Structure" of what? "REaction" for what?
- p. 496, 2nd line, misaligned
- p. 496: "little convergent" means probably "weakly convergent"?
- Fig. 7.3.1: too busy, too small characters of the boxed-in text
- p. 512: the tile of sect. 7.5.1 deserves some explanation in the text. As it stands, reader will not understand the various mysterious 
  notations and how they are connected. Also mysteriously, that notation reappears as title in sect 7.6.
- first sentence of sect. 7.5.1: "phase space" might be misleadng, "configuration space" seems to be more appropriate. Many eaders 
  porbably connect "phase space" with the kinematical on-shell phase space of a reaction. The P- and Q-space concept and the related dressing 
  by induced interactions could be a better approach.
- p. 513: as I wrote before, "clothing" -> "dressing" might be the better choice, connecting more easily to the literature
- Eq.(7.6.1): indicate the coordinates also on the RHS of the equation
- App. 7.G: I like those "cross-disciplinary" discussions but I'm afraid that the un-introduced reader will be in dispair "What to the hell that has to 
  d0 with the rest of the book". A better motivation would help, indicating the generality of the phenomena.
