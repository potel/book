1. Eq.(1.1.9): spend a few words on the classical LD-picture and the quantization (maybe by ref. to BM)
2. Fig.1.1.1: explain the dashed lines, shown in the inset; explain the doube-parabola
3. Fig.1.1.3 & 1.1.4: poor quality
4. p.20: unclear sentences:
   - "This behaviour is to be found..." that sentence mixes up a variety of pnenomena whhci better should be discussed in sperate sentences
   - "...which change in one unit.." the same is true for this sentence. 
     Such highly condensed statements appear repeatedly also at other isntances of the text. For those readers using the book as an 
     introductory textg to and /or a study text for nuclear theory, this might pose a severe problems.
5. Eq.(1.2.3) etc. : explain kappa, explain $\hat{\alpha}$
6. Eq.(1.2.6): point out that the proper in-medium interaction has to be used to. e.g. v=v(\vec{x},\rho)
7. Fig. 1.2.1: poor quality
8. Footnote: RPA sums the bubble or ring diagrams (Fig. 1.2.3), ladder diagrams are contributing to fig.1.2.2     
9. Fig. 1.2.2: left column is of poor quality; what is the rational to show (3) and /4) in additon to (1b) and (2)?; 
   (8) might be attached to (5) and (6); the phrase "bare NN-interaction" is misleading: I guess, it's the ladder-summed (Breuckner) 
   in-medium interaction what is meant
10. Caption Fig.(1.2.3): The equations (Y, 1/kappa) deserve a deeper discussions in the text
11. Fig.1.3.1: the appearance of bold "=" and "+" and $\Sigma$ disatracts the reader form the true content, namely the  diagrams.
12. Eq.(1.3.4)Ã–: a coupling constatn might be in place.
13. Fig.(1.3.2): very busy figure, many new and unexplained symbols and notations, e.g. what is $\sigma$, what is meant by the various "Q"'s? 
    Someone who is not yet an expert, might get lost. As a rule: Help the potential reader, otherwise people may give up reading the book!
14. p. 30: The phrase "...is thus gauge invariant." might be controversial in it's generality and therefore should be explained in view of that 
    QFT/QED-people have a diffferent understanding of gauge invariance, so do our friends from chiral EFT etc.  
15. Eq.(1.8.4): although the notation a^\dag(\vec r) is used frequently, I'd prefer the QFT notation \psi(\vec r) as used in many other 
    text books of quantum many-body theory - but that mighrt be a matter of personal taste
16. p.50, First paragraph: it migth be mentioned that m_\omega is related to the (energy-)slope of the dispersive self-energy 
17. Eq.(1.8.7) adn (1.8.8): definition of R_{v_i}(r)?
18. A conclusion on Chpt.1: many interesting and important topics are addressed but the rather condensed presentation might 
    bring the non-expert reader to a feeling of "getting lost". Many of the NFT aspects, you are discussing later 
    anyway in due detail, so there is no urgent need to "squeeze" them into the introduction. As I wrote before, it might be more helpful 
    to the reader to spending instead more space on the origin and structure of NN-interactions in the nuclear medium and how they lead to 
    self-binding and other cooperative dynamical effects in nuclei.
