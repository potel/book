% The files for cmmp.cls are distributed in a concatenated form (using the
% LaTeX 2e 'filecontents' environment). The file 'cmmpcls.ltx' is one of these
% files. The 'filecontents' environment allows the files to be unpacked easily
% with the correct filenames.
%
% To unpack the source files, copy the cmmpcls.ltx file to a temporary
% directory. Then pass the cmmpcls.ltx file though LaTeX 2e as if it were a
% document (i.e. TeX it with LaTeX 2e).  LaTeX will then unpack the files.
%
% cmmpcls.ltx contains the following files:
%
%   cmmp.cls        the class file
%   cmmp2egu.tex    authors' instructions
%
% If LaTeX 2e refuses to unpack the files, you probably already have
% them installed (in the TeXinput path). In this case, if the supplied files
% are newer, we strongly  recommend that you use the newer files. To do this
% rename any existing file and unpack the distribution again.
%
% Once you have unpacked the files, move the cmmp.cls file to a directory
% in the TeXinput path. Then typeset CMMP2EGU.TEX for instructions
% and examples.
