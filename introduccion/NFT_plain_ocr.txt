harmonic model. The residual pairing interactions tend to produce a conden­
sation of the boson, namely a superconducting state. This tendency drains strength from the excited into the ground state. 
II: Field theory of elementary excitations in nuclei. 
In the first p'1rt of these lectures the concept of elementary modes of ex­citation was discussed in terms of simple schematic models. The usefulness of such a concept to describe the nuclear structure was demonstrated in the 
discussion of selected examples involving pairing modes. 
Because all the nuclear degrees of freedom are exhausted by the protons and the neutrons, it is an essential feature of descriptions based on elementary modes of excit'1tion to violate the Pauli principle '1nd to requiTe the use of 
an over-complete basis. 
In the second pm·t of these lectures we develop a field theory, in which the 
nuclear elementary modes of excitation are the fermionic n,nd bosonic free 
fields, and where theiT mutual interweaving takes place through the pu,rticle­
vibration coupling and the bare model fou.T-point vertex interaction. 
5. -The concept of elementary modes of excitation. 
The Hamiltonian of a many-body system of noninteracting particles, bosons 
or fermions, can be 1vritten as 
(5.1) H=l;H;, 
where the snmmation is over all the p'1rticles of the system and where each H; depends only on the vn,ri'1bles of the i-th particle. The single-p'1rticle Schrodinger 
equation is

There lie thus two ideas behind the concept of elementary excitations ('). 
First, there is the idea that the total binding energy does not have much to do 
with the behaviom of the physical system. Thus, the state IO) is assumed to 
exist but to act only as a background whose detailed intrinsic structme one does 
not need to know to describe the bebaviom of the system. What is important 
is the belrnv:iom of the lower excited states relative to the ground state. 
'l'be second idea is that the low-lying states often aJ:'e of a p!1rticular simple 
character, and are an1enable to a simple and rjgorous mathematical treatment. 
With the help of ei-perimental probes which couple weakly to the nucleus, 
i.e. in such a way that the system can be expressed in terms of the properties of the excitation in the absence of probes, it bas been possible to identify the following elementary excitations in systems around closed shells('): 
a) single particle and boles, 
b) shape v:ibmtions, 
a) spin and isospin vibrations and charge exchange modes, 
il) pairing vibrations. 
Different probes have been utilized in the process of identification of the dif­ferent modes. In particular two-neutron transfer reactions induced by tritons and protons hrtve played a central role in unr:weling the basic featnres of the pairing modes. This subject bas been cliscussed in detail in part I of these lectnres. 
('") This concept was first introduced ,by LANDAU [53] to describe the spectrum of Ile II. Tt "\Yil.S subsequently utilized in uuclear physie.s by Baun nnd l\iOTTELSOs [GJ tn obtain n unilied description of the nuclcilr spcctrurn. (••) 'l'he rcstrictiou to closed nuclei is 1nadc to sin1plify the discussion. 'The concept of de1nentary n1odes of excitation applies equallr "\\'ell to 01lcn-shell nuclei (cf. [25]).

6. -Nuclear field theory. 
A field theory can be formulated in which the nuclear elementary modes of excitation play the role of the free fields and in which their mutual inter­weaving tall;es place tlu·ough the pctrticle-vibration coupling vertices [6, 54, 55]. This theory provides a graphical pertmbative approach to obtain the exact solution of the many-body nuclectr-structme problem in the product basis 'P,(CJ1p"(L1J ... 'P,,(I'). 
Note that the nuclear bosonic fields are built out by utilizing those degrees of freedom (particles and holes) which already exhaust all the nuclear degrees of freedom. It is thus an essential featme of the product basis to be over­complete and to violate the Pauli principle. On the other hand, this basis is directly related to observables of the system. The different experiments pro­ject out only one or two of its components. 
In what follows we state and apply the nuclear-field-theory rules, to cal­culate the interactions between the nuclear free fields and the reaction processes between the resulting physical states. This is done for a system with one par­ticle outside closed shells and which displays collective vibrations, in the frame­work of a two-level model. 
6"1. Schematic model. -The model considered consists of two single-par­ticle levels, each with degeneracy Q and with a schematic monopole particle­hole interaction coupling the particles in the two levels. 
The total Hamiltonian is equal to

The index CJ labels the two levels, while ni labels the degenerate states within each level. The strength of the monopole coupling is denoted by V and the energy difference between the two levels is E. 
The matrix element of (6.3) is given by

6"2. Field-theoretical solutions. -The free nuclea;r and fermion fields n,re the elementa;i·y modes of excitation comprising surface vibrations and single pn,rticles, respectively. The boson fields n,re defined through the random-phase approximation, in terms of particle-hole excitations. The hasis utilized to describe the nuclear systems is a product of the different free fields. This basis is, as a rule, over-complete, nonorthogonal and violates the Pauli principle. 
The closed-shell system of the schematic model under considemtion cor­responds to the lowest (a= -1) level filled with Q pa;i·ticles, while the upper (ci = 1) level remains empty. The basis pa:rticle tmd hole states a;i·e obtained by adding or removing a single pa:rticle from this closed-shell configuration. The corresponding wave functions and energies, which should include the Hartree-Fock corrections generated by the residual interaction("), are

(6.4)

Thus the unperturbed energy for producing a particle-hole excitation with respect to the ground state is 
(6.5) s' = E(m, 1) + E(rn, -1) =, + V. 
The contribution V in (6.5) is the Hn,rtree-Fock contribution to the pa;i·ticle­
hole excitation.

As shown in ref. [54-55], the exact solution of (6.1) is reproduced by utilizing as the basic degrees of freedom both the vibrations (cf. (6.8)) and the particles (cf. (6.4)) coupled through the interactions (6.3a) and (6.13). A sigrrificant pm·t of the original interaction has already been included in genem1ing the collective mode (6.8). This implies that the rules for evaluating the effect of the couplings (6.3a) and (6.13) between fermions and bosons involve a number 
NUCLEAR SurERFJ,UIDI'rY AND FIELD '.l'IIEORY OF ELEMENTARY EXCITATIONS 113 
of restrictions as compa;red with the usual rules of perturbation theory that are to be utilized in evaluating the effect of the original interaction (6.3) :10ting in a fermion space. They read as follows: 
I) In initial and final states, proper diagrams involve collective modes and particle modes, but not any pa;rticle configuration that can be replaced by a combination of collective modes. This restriction permits an initial state comprising the configuration (n, = 1; m, 1), but excludes (111, 1; 11i, -1; 111', 1). 
II) The couplings (6.3a) and (6.13) are allowed to act in all orders to generate the different diagrams of pertm-bation theory; the restriction I) does not apply to internal lines of these diagrams. 
III) The internal lines of diagrams are, however, restricted by the ex­clusion of diagrams in which a particle-hole pair is created and subsequently annihilated without having participated in subsequent intemctions. 
IV) The energies of the uncoupled pa;rticle and phonon fields are to be calculated by utilizing the Hartree-Fock approximation (cf. eq. (6.4)) and the l~PA (cf. eq. (6.8)), respectively. The contributions of all allowed diagrams are ev:i,luated by the usual rules of perturbation theory. 
We note that the external fields acting on the system a;re allowed to create any state which may generate the different diagrams of perturhation theory. The corresponding matrix elements should be weighted with the amplitude of the component through which the final st'1te is excited. 
The above rules are also valid for those situations which cannot be treated in pertm-bation theory and where a full diagonalization is called for. Thus, e.g., when the system displays a spurious state (cf. sect. 7). 
In what follows we discuss the energy of the 2p-lh-like excitations. We distinguish between two types of states, namely 
W1=E1-V.Q, A1 = -VQV (i = 1; 111 = 1, 2, ... ' Q), 
(6.14) [n, = 1; m, 1),

and(") 
(6.15) lni, 1; 1n, -1; 1n', 1), c' (m, 1n1=1, 2, ... , Q). 
(•) Since the states (6.lfi) are restricted to be interrnediate stntcs of tho perturbation expansion, the eonfignratioll (rn, 1; 'Jn, -1; 'In, 1) is allff\\'ctl.

In fact, the st<tte In, = 1; m, 1) has " nonvanishing matrix element, implying a single particle-vibration coupling vertex, with the state Im, 1; 11i, -1; m, 1). This component, which is spmious, is removed by the dif­ferent gmphs displ<tyed in fig. 19 and 20. The presence of the odd particle (m, 1) hlocks the particle-hole excitation (m, 1; "" -1) which was present in the uncoupled system. Thus the system increases its energy by a quantity V. The reduction of the inelastic amplitude from \IQ to ·vQ -l also indicates that there is one less p'1rticle-hole excitation responding to the external probe. 
7. -Spm·ious states. 
While the model space product of elementary modes of excitation discussed in the last section contains !J' states, only Q(Q -1) are physically possible, the number of spurious states being Q. On the other hand, the agreement between the e'rnct and the nuclear-field-theoretical results shows that the ef­fects of those spurious states are eliminated from all the matrix clements as­sociated with physical observables. 
In what follows we show that, in fact, the spurious states are isolated in 'm explicit way in the nuclear field theory [55]. Their energy coincides with the initial nnperturbed energy, while all physical operators have zero off-diagonal matrix elements between any physical state and a spmious state, in particul'1r the unit operntor, which measures the overlap of the two types of states. 
For this purpose \\re use again a schema.tic model consisting in a number, Q,

We now c11lculate the one-particle stripping process leading to the odd system. This calculation illustrates the explicit concentration of the whole spuriosity into a single state which has zero correlation energy n and zero for the different physic11l processes exciting the Q -1 physic11l states. 
One has first to calculate the amplitude for the tmnsition to a basis com­ponent (n, = l; m, 1) including only those graphs in which all intermedi'1tc states are excluded from appearing as initial or final states. reflects the fact that the diagonalization procedure has included all interaction effects that link these allowed states. The final amplitude for the transition to the state (qin) is obtained by summing the amplitudes to (n, = each weighted by the amplitude ~"m given by eq. (7.18).

The result (7.35) coincides with the exact result. Physically it means that the single-particle orbital (m, 1) is blocked by the amount Ai/(sm -w 1)', which is the prob'1bility that the phonon (n1 = 1) is in the particle-hole configum­tion (m,l; ?>1,-1), i.e. with its particle in the orbital (in, 1). 
ll. -Applications. 
In wh'1t follows we discuss some aspects of tho low-lying spectrum of the nucleus '"Bi in terms of fermions, surface (/i'(O).)) and pairing (/l'(2,\)) modes. The application to states cont'1ining two or more p'1iring and surface phonons will be discussed by BoI<'I'IGNON [57].

(8.2) 


This constitutes the basis set of states {o:,}. All other states give rise to the complementary Hilbert space {a,). The elementary modes of excit'1tion interact through the particle-vibra­tion and folll'-point vertices displayed in fig. 23 giving rise to the matI·ix elements

They are to be C'1lculated by utilizing the graphic11l techniques of perturb'1tion theory '1nd the rules discussed in sect. 6. 
There are two p'1r£lmeters on which to exp'1nd upon in c11rrying out l1 per­i;urbative calcul'1tion. The first one is the strength of the interaction vertices measured in terms of the '1Vernge distance between single-particle levels. The second is l/Q, where Q =I (i + tl is the effective degeneracy of the valence

shells. These two parameters are in general connected through involved ex­
pressions. In the schen1atic model discussed in sect. 6, however, their relation is cx:plicit ancl can be expressed as

Another featurn which determines the family of diagrams to select to a given order of pertmbation is the number of internal lines which can be freely sum­med up. Each of these summations introduces a multiplicative factor Q. 
Because most of the present knowledge on the applicability of the field­theoretical techniques rests upon schematic models, we utilize 1/Q as the expansion parameter, and assume the relations (8.4) to be valid for more general situations. 
The nucleus '""Bi has been investigated by means of high-resolution inelastic scattering [58] and Coulomb excitation [59]. Through these e>.-periments a septuplet of states around 2.6 JVIeV of excitation was identified, with spins 
5
ranging from fr+ to 12+.

In zeroth order these states can be interpreted in terms of a proton moving in the h, orbital coupled to the lowest octupole vibration of ""Pb. The il+ of 
' " 

this multiplet displays also a large parentage based on the proton pair addition 
and proton hole moving in the d1 orbital, as revealed by the (1;, ") reaction 
on "'Po [60]. 
The above results indicate that the (two-particle, one-hole) type of states 

in ~00Bi are amenable to a simple description in term of the basis sta,tes

The quadrupole surface vibration modes were allowed only as intermediate states. The single hole and particle states i;-' and j,, respectively, correspond to experimentally known levels around the Z = 82 shell closme. 
In what follows we iliscuss the ilifferent properties of the states generated by the basis spanned by the eigenvectors l2J., i;-'; I11I) and !OJ., i,; nrI). We have divided the discussion in two parts. 
In the fil'St part the two t states built out of the ld1' 0 gs("'Po)) and lh103-("'Pb)) configurations are studied in this space. This two-state system provides a rich laboratory to study the interplay of surface and pai.riug modes. 
In. the second part the properties of the entire multiplet and of those states st.rongly excited in either the (t, C<) or (d, d') reactions are studied, in the com­plete configuration space.

b) The 11mltiplet. 
By utilizing all the states of the basis, and the same techniques discussed '1bovc, the states that are stTongly excited in at least one of three reactions (d, d'), (t, Ol) and ('He, d) were calculated. The resulting spectroscopic ampli­tudes and relative cross-sections arc collected in table VJI. 
The picture of the nuclear states achieved in terms of the elementary modes of excitation ilisplays in a transparent manner the correlation aspects of the nuclear dynan1ics. 
Resume. 
We have shown that the nucleacr-field description of the nuclear structure is mathematically correct (cf. sect. 6 and 7) and that it smoothly joins the ranks of quantum electrodynamics and many-body field theories. We have also shown that its predictions are borne out by the experiment. 
One thus achieves a simple picture of the nuclea;r structure. Each wave function, which is an exact solution of the m'1uy-body problem, contains only few components. Each of these components carry a label which re'1ds: "Only to be excited through inelastic smttering 11 or «Only to be excited in one­particle pickup reactions», i.e. each component corresponds to an observable, associated with '1 concrete experiment one knows how to carry out with the help of '1Ccelerators, detectors and targets.
