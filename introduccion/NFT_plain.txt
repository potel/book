6`2. Field-theoretiea-Z solutions. - The free nuclear and ferniion fields are
the eleinentary modes of excitation coinprising surface vibrations and single
particles, respectively. The boson iields are donned through the random-phase
approximation, in terms of particle-hole excitations. The basis utilized to
describe the nuclear systems is a product of the different free iields. This basis
is, as a rule, over-complete, nonorthogonai and violates the Pauli principle.
The closed-shell system of the schematic model under consideration eor-
responds to the lowest (o = - 1) level iiiled with .Q particles, While the upper
(o” == 1) level remains empty. The basis particle and hole states are obtained
by adding or removing a single particle from this closed-shell eoniigiiration.

From (6.8), (6.10) and (6.11) We obtain
(6.12) /1. = - Tfw/FJ,
which is the strength with which a particle~hole excitation (in, 1; m, -1)
couples to the collective phonon (see iig. 18). This can also be seen by calculating
the matrix element of the interaction Ha-nnltonian (6.3) between the normal
modes and the single particle-hole state
(6.13) 11,1 = (nv 2 1|HTBfm, 1; in/, - 1) = - Vx/§d(1n, M/)r5(11,1).

normal modes lying at an energy s' are equal to zero.

As shown in ref. [54-55], the exact solution of (6.1) is reproduced by utilizing
as the basic degrees of freedom both the vibrations (cf. (6.8)) and the particles
(ef. (6.-4)) coupled through the interactions (6.3a) and (6.13). A signiiioant
port of the original interaction has already been included in generating the
collective inode (6.S). _This implies that the rules for evaluating the effect of
the couplings (6.3a) and (6.13) between ferinions and bosone involve a number
NUCLEAR SUTPERFLUIDITY AND FIELD TIIEDRY OF EI.El\El\lTAIiY EXCITATION5  
of restrictions as compared with the usual rules of perturbation theory that
are to be utilized in evaluating the effect of the original interaction (6.3) acting
in a fermion space. They read as follows:
I) In initial and final states, proper dia-grains involve collective modes
and particle modes, but not any particle conliguration that can be replaced by
a combination ol collective modes. This restriction permits an initial state
comprising the configuration (ai m 1; m,1), but excludes (m,1;au,-1; in/,1).
Il) The couplings (6.3a) and (6.13) are allowed to act in all orders to
generate the dilierent diagrams oi perturbation theory; the restriction I) does
not apply to internal lines ol these diagrams.
III) The internal lines of diagrams are, however, restricted by the ei;-
clusion oi diagrams in which a particle-hole pair is created and subsequently
annihilated Without having participated in subsequent interactions.
1-"T
IV) The energies of the uncoupled particle and phonon fields are to be
calculated by utilizing the lilartree-Fool: approximation (cf. eq. (6.a)) and the
RPA (cf. eq. (6_S)), respectively. The contributions of all allowed diagrams are
evaluated by the usual rules oi perturbation theory.
We note that the external fields acting on the system are allowed to create
any state which may generate the different diagrams of perturbation theory.
The corresponding matrix elements should be weighted with the amplitude of
the component through which the iiual state is excited.
The above rules are also valid for those situations which cannot be treated
in perturbation theory and where a full diagonalization is called for. Thus,
ag., when the system displays a spurious state (ci. sect. 7).
In what follows We discuss the energy of the Ep-1h~li]re excitations. We
distinguish between two types of states, namely

do not carry any inelastic strength, a feature which is closely related to the
fact that they cannot be normalized and that they do not display any corre-

On the other hand, the matrix element associated with (6.25a) is
_ .Q Q41 FW..
(5.29) (q-m|./l*|'m, l> = _fi R75 2 Qml’
which agrees with the exact answer.
The results (62512) and (5.29) can be traced down to ]§’auli-principle correc-
ticns. In fact, the state |a, = 1; m,1> has a nonyanishing matrix element,
implying a single particle-vibration coupling ycrte, with the state |m,1;
fm,-1; m,1>. This ccmpcnent, which is spurious, is removed by the dif-
ferent graphs displayed in fig. 19 and 20. The presence of the odd particle
(m, 1) blocks the particle-hole excitation (m,1; m,- 1) which was present in
the nnccupled system. Thus the system increases its energy by a quantity V.
The reduction of the inelastic amplitude from \/,j to -\/Q';~Jf also indicates
that there is one less particle-hole excitation responding to the external probe.
7. - Spurious states..
While the model space product of elementary modes of excitation discussed
in the last section contains Q2 states, only .Q{Q - 1) are physically possible,
the number of spurious states being _(Q. On the other hand, the agreement
between the exact and the nuclear-field-theoretical results shows that the ef-
fcets of those spurious states are eliminated from all the matrix elements as-
sociated With physical observables.
In what follows We show that, in fact, the spurious states are isolated in as
explicit Way in the nuclear field theory [55]. Their energy coincides with the
initial unpertui-bed energy, While all physical operators have zero o£E-diagonal
matrix elements between any physical state and a spurious state, in particular
the unit operator, which measures the overlap of the two types of states.
For this purpose we use again a schematic model consisting in a number, Q,
of single-particle levels in which particles interact by means oi a << moncpole »

Where |f.»a{ = 1) denotes a state containing one phonon, While |m,1; m,-1)
is the eigenstate associated with particlediole excitation.
The other interaction to be included (rule II)) is the founpcint vertex which
has the value
(7.8) (fm, 1; m’, - 1[H-lm_)?7’1¢”,1;?Ytm,- 1) = - Vd(m, m’)d(fm,”, mm) .
The single-particle energies to be used in calculating the diiferent ,graphs are
gem, as the Hartree-Foclc contribution (cf. rule IV)) of HIM is zero.
Similarly to Em, the << inelastic operator »> has two different matrix elements,
namely
(7.9) <s, = lfs;-_,s.m»__1|o> =  
and
(7.10) (mf, 1; fm", - l|c;'1am,_1|0> m c$(m, m’)c5{m’, im/') .
In what follows We discuss again the system comprising an odd particle, in
the orbit (m,1), in addition to a single phonon excitation of the vacuum.
According to rule I) initial and iinal states may involve both collective mode
and particle modes, but not any pamticle conliguratiou that can be replaced by
a combination of collective modes. The exclusion of the states |m,1; m',1;
fm/, 41) ehrnjnates most of the double counting of two-particle, one-hole states.
The .Q aproper » states of the form [af = 1; m,1) are allowed. However,

there are only _Q - 3. (two-pertiele, one»ho1e) states in which the odd particle

the elementary modes of excitation.

We now calculate the one-particle stripping process leading to the odd system.
This calculation illustrates the explicit concentration of the whole spuriosity
into a single state which has zero correlation energy (°) and zero arnplitude
for the different physical processes exciting the Q- 1 physical states.
One has first to calculate the amplitude for the transition to a basis coni-
ponent (fa, = 1; fm, 1) including only those graphs in which all intermediate
states are excluded from appearing as initial or iinal states. This exclusion
reflects the fact that the cliagonalization procedure has included all interaction
eilects that link these allowed states. The final amplitude for the transition
to the state (gm) is obtained by srunrning the amplitudes to (af = 1;'n1,1)
each weighted by the aniplitudc 5mm given by eq. (118),

The result (7.35) coincides with the exact result. Physically it means that
the single-particle orbital (ra, 1) is blocked by the amount _/12/(sm - mi)“, which
is the probability that the phonon (ai = 1) is in the particle-hole eoniigura-
tion (m,l; m,-1), ic. with its particle in the orbital (m,l).
3. - Applications.
In what follows We discuss some aspects of the low-lying spectrum of the
nucleus “Bi in terms ot fermions, surface ()5"'(G?.)) and pairing (,5'l(2,l)) modes.
The application to states containing two or more pairing and smfaee phonons
will be discussed by ]3o1rr1eNoN [57}.

They are to be calculated by utilizing the graphical techniques of perturbation

There are two parameters on which to expand upon in carrying out a per-
turbative calculation. The iirst one is the strength of the interaction vertices
measured in terms of the average distance between single-particle levels. The
second is 1/Q, where .Q = E (gi ~|- lf) is the effective degeneracy oi the valence
if
shells. These two parameters are in general connected through involved ex~
pressions. In the schematic model discussed in sect. 6, however, then relation
is explicit and can lic expressed as '
Fig. 23. - Interactions coupling the ferniion Holds with the pairing and surface
vibrations. The different ferinion and boson free fields are i particle, + hole, 1* pairing
vibration (iz=.‘2), *pairing vibratioii (ac:-2),   surface vibration (aa: D). The two
possible four-point vertices are given in o) and b). They correspond to the pairing and
particle-hole model be-re interactions. In graphs c}-k} all possible couplings between
the ferrnion iields (nrrowed lines) and the pairing vibrational Holds (double lines
arrowed) are displayed. Graphs fi)-Z) are all the coupling vertices between the surface
vibrations (wavy ]_ine} and the ferniion iields. Note that there is no direct coupling
between the two boson field, as the Eicld theory we are dealing with is linear in the
different field co-ordinates.
Another feature which determines the family of diagrams to select to a given
order of perturbation is the number of internal lines which can be freely surn-
nied up. Each of these surumations introduces a multiplicative factor Q.
Because most of the present knowledge on the applicability of the field-
theoretical techniques rests upon Schematic models, we utilize 1/.Q as the
expansion parameter, and assume the relations (8.4) to be valid for more general
situations.
The nucleus =“"Bi has been investigated by means of liigh-resolution inelastic
scattering [58] and Coulomb excitation [59]. Through these experiments ia
septuplet of states -around 2.6 MeV of excitation was identified, with spins
ranging from if to %'i+. '
NUCLEAR SUPERFLUIDITY AND FIELD THEORY OF ELEMENTARY EXCITATION5  
In zeroth order these states can be interpreted in terms of a proton moving
in the li; orbital coupled to the lowest octupole vibration of ”°*‘l°b. The if of
this multiplet displays also a large parentage based on the proton pair addition
and proton hole moving in the dy orbital, as revealed' by the (t, rx) reaction
on “Po [60].
The above results indicate that the (two-particle, one-hole) type of states

Only the lowest states of each spin and parity Z” are included in the basis
states, while all the RPA solutions are included in the intermediate states.
The quadrupole surface vibration modes were allowed only as intermediate
states. The single hole and particle states jf and jg, respectively, correspond
to experimentally known levels around the Z w 82 shell closure.
In what follows we discuss the diferent properties of the states generated
by the basis spanned by the eigenvectors §2/l,jf1;IM> and |o/1,§2;IM>. We
have divided the discussion in two parts.
In the first part the two Q-+ states built out of the idf ®gs(”1°l’o)> and
fh§ ®3`(“°“Pb)> coniiurations are studied in this space. This two-state system
provides a rich laboratory to study the interplay of surface and pairing modes,
In the second part the properties of the entire multiplet and of those states
strongily excited in either the (t, or) or (d, d') reactions are studied, in the coni-
plete coniiguration space.

Because of the energy dependence of hm there is a different matrix element
for each final state. The diagonalization of the matrices was carried out self-
consistcntly, ale, the energy denominators oi the diii'erent graphs are to be
calculated by utilizing the exact energies (for more details, ci. ref. [81l]).

through the component of type |1>, the diiicrence between R, and R, can be
traced back to the over-completeness of the basis which give rise to rather dil-
ferent normalizations of the two physical states (ci. sect. 7).
b) The malt-iplet.
By utilizing all the states of the basis, and the same techniques discussed
above, the states that are strongly excited in at least one of three reactions
(cl, df), (t, cr) and (=‘]EIe, d) were calculated. The resulting spectroscopic ainpli-
tudes and relative cross-sections are collected in table VII.
The pict1u'e of the nuclear states achieved in terms of the elementary rnodes
ot excitation displays in a transparent manner the correlation aspects of the
nuclear dynamics.
Résumé.
We have shown that the nuclear-held description of the nuclear structme
is inathernatically correct (cf. sect. 6 and 7) and that it smoothly joins the ranlrs
of quantum electrodjgrnannes and many-body ‘deld theories. We have also
shown that its predictions are borne out by the enperinient.
One thus achieves a simple picture of the nuclear siuucture. Each Wave
function, which is an exact solution of the many-body problem, contains only
few' components. Each of these components carry a label which reads: <1 Only
to be excited through inelastic scattering ll or << Only to be excited in onc-
particle pickup reactions il, Le. each component corresponds to an observable,
associated with a concrete egerinient one knows how to carry out with the
help of accelerators, detectors and targets.
