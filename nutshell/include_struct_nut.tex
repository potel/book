\section{Nuclear Structure in a nutshell}\label{C1S1}
The low-energy properties of the finite, quantal, many-body nuclear system, in which nucleons interact through the strong force of strength $v_0(\approx -100$ MeV) and range $a(\approx 0.9$ fm) are controlled, in first approximation, by independent particle motion. This is a consequence of the fact that nucleons display a sizable value of the quantal zero point (kinetic) energy of localization ($\hbar^2/Ma^2\approx 50$ MeV) as compared to the absolute value of the strength of the $NN$--potential\footnote{\label{f1C3} The corresponding ratio $q=\left(\frac{\hbar^2}{Ma^2}\right)\frac{1}{|v_0|}$ is known as the quantality parameter and was first used in connection with the study of condensed matter (\cite{deBoer:48,deBoer:57,deBoer:48b,Nosanow:76}). It  was introduced in nuclear physics in \cite{Mottelson:02} where its value $q=0.5$ testifies to the validity of independent particle motion. It is of notice that questions like the one posed in connection with localization and long mean free path were already discussed by \cite{Lindemann:10} in connection with the study of the stability or less of crystals. The generalization to aperiodic crystals, like e.g. proteins (\cite{Schrodinger:44}) was carried out in \cite{Stillinger:90}. Its possible application to the atomic nucleus is discussed in App. \ref{C2AppC} } $|v_0|=100$ MeV. 

The corresponding ground state $\ket{HF}=\Pi_ia^\dagger_i\ket{0}$ describes a step function in the probability of the occupied ($\epsilon_i\leq \epsilon_F$) and empty ($\epsilon_k>\epsilon_F$) states, displaying a sharp discontinuity at the Fermi surface. Pushing the system it reacts with an inertia $AM$, sum of the nucleon masses (App. \ref{App1.D}). Setting it into rotation, assuming the density $\rho(r)=\sum_i|\braket{\mathbf r|i}|^2$ ($\ket{i}=a^\dagger_i\ket{0}$) to be spatially deformed, it responds with the rigid moment of inertia. This is because the single-particle orbitals are solidly anchored to the mean field (Fig. \ref{fig1A3}).

Pairing acting on nucleons moving in time reversal states $\nu,\bar\nu$ ($\nu\equiv(nlj)$), in configurations of the type ($(l)^2_{L=0},(s)^2_{S=0}$), and lying close to the Fermi energy, alter the above picture in a conspicuous way\footnote{\cite{Bohr:58}; see also \cite{Broglia:13} and references therein.}. Within an energy range of the order of the absolute value of the pair correlation energy\footnote{In BCS, $E_{corr}\approx-\frac{N(0)}{2}\Delta^2$, where $N(0)=\frac{g}{2}$ is the density of nuclear states at the Fermi energy and for one spin orientation, $g_i=i/16$ MeV$^{-1}$ ($i=N,Z$) being the result of an empirical estimate which takes surface effects into account (\cite{Bohr:75} Eq. (2-47); \cite{Bortignon:98} Eq. (7.15)), while $\Delta$ is the pairing gap, $2\Delta$ being the binding energy of the Cooper pair. For a typical superfluid, quadrupole deformed nucleus like $^{170}$Yb, $N(0)=5.3$ MeV$^{-1}$, $\Delta\approx1.1$ MeV and $E_{corr}=-3.2$ MeV (\cite{Shimizu:89}).} $|E_{corr}|(\approx 3 $MeV) centered around $\epsilon_F$ ($|E_{corr}|/\epsilon_F\ll1$), the role of independent particles is taken over by  pairs of nucleons, correlated over distances $\xi\approx\hbar v_F/(\pi\Delta)\,(\approx 14$ fm; $\Delta=1.2$ MeV), and being equally phased (see Sect. \ref{App1D}). In other words, and bringing the argument to a previous step, one can posit that since the creation operators $a^\dagger_i$ commute for different $i$'s, $\ket{HF}$ represents uncorrelated occupancy of the different single-particle states. Similarly, because the pair operators $P^\dagger_\nu$ commute for different $\nu$'s, $\ket{BCS}$ represents uncorrelated occupancy of the various pair states.  The (single-particle)-Cooper pair\footnote{\cite{Cooper:56}.} parallel is summarized in Fig. \ref{fig1D2}.


For intrinsic\footnote{As opposed to collective excitations which do not alter the temperature of the system, as all the energy is concentrated in a single mode.} nuclear excitation energies and rotational frequencies\footnote{Coriolis force acts oppositely on each member of a Cooper pair. When the difference in rotational energy between superfluid and normal rotation becomes about equal to the correlation energy, the nucleon moving opposite to the collective rotation becomes so much retarded in its revolution period with respect to the partner nucleon, that eventually it cannot correlate any more with it and ``align'', its motion (and spin) with the rotational motion, becoming again a pair of fermions and not participating in the BCS  condensate. This happens for a (critical) angular momentum $I_c\approx(120\times|E_{corr}|)^{1/2}\approx 20\hbar$, corresponding to a rotational frequency $\hbar\omega_c\approx 0.5$ MeV (see \cite{Bohr:75}, \cite{Broglia:13} and references therein).} sensibly smaller than $|E_{corr}/2|$ and than $\hbar\omega_{rot}\approx0.5$ MeV respectively, the system can be described in terms of gauge phase correlated,  pair motion. This is a consequence of the fact that the kinetic energy of (Cooper) pair confinement ($\hbar^2/(2M\xi^2)\approx 10^{-2}$ MeV), is much smaller than the absolute value of the pair binding energy $|E_{corr}|$, implying that each pair behaves as an entity\footnote{The ratio $q_\xi=\frac{\hbar^2}{2M\xi^2}\frac{1}{|E_{corr}|}\approx 0.02$ provides a generalized quantality parameter. It testifies to the stability of nuclear Cooper pairs in superfluid nuclei.} of mass $2M$ and intrinsic structure $L=S=0$. Cooper pairs behave like (quasi) bosons, the single-particle orbits on which they correlate become dynamically detached from the mean field, leading to a BCS condensate. It is however very different from a standard condensate of real bosons. Within this context see  Sect. \ref{App1D} (Figs. \ref{fig1A4} and \ref{fig1A5}) and App. \ref{App3E}.

It is of notice the large experimental errors of the corresponding angular distributions associated with the poor statistics of the cross section at the first maximum $\theta=5^{\circ}$. This is the reason why the maximum at $59^\circ$ was preferred to report the ratio of the cross sections. (b) Schematic representation of the pairing vibrational spectrum around $^{208}$Pb. Also shown is a cartoon representation of the softening of the sharp mean field Fermi surface due to the ZPF of the pairing vibrational modes. The label $a$ and $r$ indicate the pair addition and pair removal modes. It is to be noted that a linear term in $N$ has been added to the binding energy to make the binding energy values associated with $^{206}$Pb ($N=124$) and $^{210}$Pb ($N=128$), equal, in an attempt to emphasize a harmonic picture for the two-phonon state. Concerning the anharmonicities of the modes see last paragraph Sect. \ref{App1E}.}\label{fig1.1}
\end{figure}



 Cooper pairs exist also in situations in which the environmental conditions are above critical. For example, in metals at room temperature, in closed shell nuclei as well as in deformed open shell ones at high values of the angular momentum\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Shimizu:90} and references therein.}. However, in such circumstances, they break essentially as soon as they are generated (pairing vibrations). While these pair addition and substraction fluctuations have little effect in condensed matter systems with the exception than at\footnote{See \cite{Schmidt:68}, \cite{Schmid:69} \cite{Abrahams:68}; concerning superfluid $^3$He see \cite{Wolfe:78}.} $T\approx T_c$ (critical temperature), they play an important role in normal (non-superfluid) nuclei. In particular around  closed shells\footnote{See Sects. \ref{App1E} and \ref{App1AF}; \cite{Bohr:64}, \cite{Bes:66}, \cite{Hogassen:61}, \cite{Schmidt:72}, \cite{Schmidt:68}, \cite{Barranco:01}, \cite{Potel:13}, \cite{Potel:14}, \cite{Schmidt:64}.} (Fig. \ref{fig1.1}), and specially in the case of light, highly polarizable, exotic halo nuclei\footnote{See \cite{Potel:13} and refs. therein. Also \cite{Potel:13b} in connection with the closed shell system $^{132}$Sn.}. From this vantage point one can posit that it is not so much, or, at least not only, the superfluid phase which is abnormal in the nuclear case, but the normal state around the closed shell systems, displaying a consistent component of dynamical abnormal density. The importance of pairing vibrations is also found in connection with the self-energy of nucleons moving around closed shells\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Bes:71,Flynn:71}.} as well as concerning the binding energy of the closed shell systems\footnote{\cite{Baroni:04}.}.
 
 
  Furthermore, it is of notice the role pairing vibrations play in the  transition between superfluid and normal nuclear phases (cf. Fig. \ref{fig1.2}) as a function of the rotational frequency (angular momentum) as emerged from the experimental studies of high spin states carried out by, among others, Garrett and collaborators\footnote{\cite{Garrett:85,Garrett:86}, see also \cite{Shimizu:89}, \cite{Barranco:87b} and Ch. 6 of \cite{Brink:05}.}.
 While the (dynamic) pairing gap associated with pairing vibrations leads to  $\approx$ 20\% increase of the static pairing gap for low rotational frequencies, it becomes the overwhelming contribution above the critical frequency\footnote{\cite{Shimizu:89}, \cite{Shimizu:90}, \cite{Shimizu:13},  \cite{Donau:99}, \cite{Shimizu:00}.}.
 
 
 
  The central role played by pairing vibrations within the present circumstances is that to restore particle-number conservation, another example after that provided by the quantality parameter and by its generalization to pair motion, of the fact that potential functionals are, as a rule, best profited by special arrangements of particles (spontaneous symmetry breaking), while fluctuations favor symmetry\footnote{\cite{Anderson:84,Anderson:76}.}. Within this context see Eqs. (\ref{eq0.1.91}) and (\ref{eq0.1.95}).
  
  
  There are a number of methods which allows one to go beyond BCS mean-field approximation, or of its generalization known as the Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov approximation (HFB). Generally referred to as number projection methods\footnote{cf. \cite{Ring:80}, \cite{Egido:13}, \cite{Robledo:13}; cf. also \cite{Frauendorf:13}, \cite{Ring:13}, \cite{Heenen:13}, and references therein.}(NP), they make use of a variety of techniques like Generator Coordinate Method, etc. as well as protocols like variation after projection, etc. The advantages of NP methods over the RPA is to lead to smooth functions for both the correlation energy and the pairing gap at the pairing phase transition between normal and superfluid phases. 
  
  In Fig. \ref{fig1.3} we display the excitation function associated with the reaction $^{122}$Sn$(p,t)^{120}$Sn($J^\pi$), populating the low-energy states of the single open shell  superfluid nucleus $^{120}$Sn. The angle selected to report the value of the absolute differential cross sections, that is $5^\circ$, corresponds to the first, and largest, peak of the absolute $L=0$ differential two-nucleon transfer cross section. Essentially all the strength in the $L=0$ channel is concentrated in the ground state, the strongest $0^+$--excited state carrying a cross section of the order of 3\% of that of the ground state. Within this context, the difference with the results displayed in Fig. \ref{fig1.1} is apparent\footnote{\label{f19} While this ``distortion'' of the $(t,p)$ excitation function is useful to emphasize the parallels between vibrational and rotational bands in 3D-and in gauge-spaces, it has to be used with care concerning the parallel with Cooper pair tunneling between weakly coupled superconductors (Sect. \ref{C3AppC} and in particular, Sect. \ref{S7.3}). This is also in keeping with the fact that at the basis of nuclear BCS one finds an  interdisciplinary connection (see \cite{Bohr:58}).}.
  
  In the inset to Fig. \ref{fig1.3} a quantity closely related to the Sn--isotopes binding energy is displayed (bold face levels). Namely $B$($^{50+N}$Sn$_N$)-8.124$N$ MeV+46.33 MeV, resulting from the substraction of the contribution of the single nucleon addition to the nuclear binding energy (linear function in $N$)  obtained by a linear fitting of the binding energies of all the Sn-isotopes. 
  Also displayed is the parabolic fit to these energies, a quantity to be compared with $E_N=(\hbar^2/2\mathcal I)(N-N_0)^2$, namely the energy associated with the members of the pairing rotational band. The difference with the spectrum of pair addition and substraction modes displayed in Fig. \ref{fig1.1} b) is again evident.  Concerning the parallel one can draw between the 3D- and pairing-vibrations and -rotations, see Fig. \ref{fig1D1}.

  \subsection[Pairing rotational and vibrational bands with transfer]{Pairing rotational and vibrational bands probed with one- and two-nucleon transfer}\label{S3.1.1}
  A simple estimate of the pairing rotational band moment of inertia is provided by the single $j$-shell model\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Brink:05} App. H and refs. therein.}, namely ($\hbar^2/2\mathcal I$)=$G/4\approx25/(4N_0)$ MeV. This estimate turns out to be rather accurate. Certainly better than one can expect. On the other hand, one is reminded of the fact that we are discussing properties which specifically characterize a coherent state\footnote{See  Sect. \ref{C8S2}; see also \cite{Potel:17}.}, namely $\ket{BCS}$ (see Eq. (\ref{eq0.1.74})).
  
  

  Also reported in  Fig. \ref{fig1.3} (inset), are the integrated values of the measured absolute two-neutron transfer cross sections, quantities which are reproduced by the theoretical predictions within experimental errors (Fig. \ref{fig1.5}). In principle, one could have expected a sensible constancy of these cross sections (transitions) as the pairing rotational model implies a common intrinsic deformed state in gauge space, namely $\ket{BCS}$ (see Eq. (\ref{eq0.1.101})). On the other hand, the number of Cooper pairs $\alpha'_0$ which defines deformation in gauge space is rather small ($\approx6$) and thus subject to conspicuous fluctuations  ($\Delta\alpha'_0/\alpha'_0\approx\sqrt{6}/6\approx 0.4$).  Because $\sigma\sim\alpha'^{2}_0$, fluctuations in $\sigma$ of the order of 100\%, can be expected.  
  
  In keeping with the analogies discussed in connection with Figs. \ref{fig1D1} and \ref{fig1A3}  between pairing and quadrupole rotational bands, we note that in the electromagnetic decay of these last bands one expects, in the case of heavy nuclei, fluctuations of the order of $(\sqrt{200}/200)$, in keeping with the magnitude of the associated $B(E2)$ values, when measured in terms of single-particle units. Within this context, the average value of the absolute experimental cross sections displayed in the inset of Fig. \ref{fig1.3} is 1762 $\mu$b, while the average difference between experimental and predicted values\footnote{\cite{Potel:13b}.} is 94 $\mu$b. Thus, the discrepancies between theory and experiment are bound in the interval $0\leq|1-\sigma_{th}(i\to f)/\sigma_{exp}(i\to f)|\leq 0.09$, the average discrepancy being 5\%.
  
  
  In Fig. \ref{fig1.4} the excited pairing rotational bands based on $0^+$ pairing vibrational modes are displayed as a single band, resulting from the average  value of the $0^+$ excited states with energy $\leq$3 MeV. The best parabolic fit is shown. Also given are the relative $(p,t)$ absolute integrated cross sections normalized to the corresponding values of the ground state rotational band. The cross talk between bands is in all cases $\leq$ 8\%, the single $j$-shell value estimate being\footnote{\cite{Brink:05} App. H.} 6\%.
  
The above results underscore the fact that, at the basis of an operative coarse grained approximation to the nuclear many-body problem, one finds a judicious choice of the collective coordinates\footnote{In this connection, we quote allegedly from S. Weinberg: ``In solving a problem you may choose to use the degrees of freedom you like. But if you choose the wrong ones you will be sorry''.} which in turn is closely connected with the probe used to study the system. In other words, pairing vibrations are elementary modes of excitation containing the right physics to restore gauge invariance through their interweaving with  quasiparticle states (Eqs. (\ref{eq0.1.95})--(\ref{eq0.1.98})). They project from the deformed state ($\alpha_0'\neq0$), the members (Eq. (\ref{eq0.1.101})) of pairing rotational bands which, similarly to pairing vibrational bands, are specifically excited in two-nucleon transfer reactions. Examples are provided by Cooper pair tunneling in heavy ion collisions between superfluid nuclei, as well as ($t,p$), ($p,t$), etc reactions\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Yoshida:62}, \cite{Glendenning:65}, \cite{Bohr:64}, \cite{Bayman:71},  \cite{Broglia:73},  \cite{Hansen:12} and \cite{Potel:13} and references therein.}. From other fields of physics, the Josephson\footnote{\cite{Josephson:62}.} effect between weakly coupled metallic superconductors is rightly considered the paradigmatic example.

In the inset the  neutron pairing rotational band between magic numbers $N=50$ and $N=82$ is  displayed (see also caption to Fig. \ref{fig0.4.5}), the absolute $^{A+2}$Sn ($p,t$) $^{A}$Sn experimental cross sections taken from \cite{Guazzoni:99}, \cite{Guazzoni:04}, \cite{Guazzoni:06}, \cite{Guazzoni:08}, \cite{Guazzoni:11}, \cite{Guazzoni:12}, are also given in $\mu$b (number connected by lines to the corresponding levels of the pairing rotational band).}\label{fig1.3}

Also indicated is the percentage of cross section for two-neutron transfer to excited states, normalized to the cross sections populating the ground states.

\end{figure}

Within this context one can now take the basic consequence of pairing condensation in nuclei regarding reaction mechanisms. For this purpose let us consider a \textit{gedankenexperiment} in which the superfluid target and the projectile can at best come in  weak contact.  Because $\left(\hbar^2/2M\xi^2\right)/|E_{corr}|\approx10^{-2}$, Cooper pairs in superfluid nuclei behave as (potentially) very extended entities of mean square radius $(\xi\gg R_0)$ and mass $2M$,  even in the case in which the $^1S_0$, $NN$-potential vanishes in the zone between the weakly overlapping densities of the two interacting nuclei. One then expects Cooper pair transfer to be observed. Not only. One also expects  the associated absolute differential cross section to be of the same order of magnitude than one-nucleon transfer ones, and to be dominated by successive transfer. These expectations have been confirmed experimentally\footnote{\label{f28} Both in heavy ion reaction between superfluid nuclei (\cite{Montanari:14}, see also Fig. \ref{fig4.6.1} and Sect. \ref{S7.3}) and light ions ($d,p$) and $(t,p)$ reaction. See e.g. \cite{Cavallaro:17} $d\sigma(^9\text{Li} (d,p)^{10}\text{Li} (1/2^-))/d\Omega|_{\theta_{max}}\approx0.8$ mb/sr, as compared to \cite{Tanihata:08}  $d\sigma(^{11}\text{Li} (p,t)^{9}\text{Li} (1/2^-))/d\Omega|_{\theta_{max}}\approx1 $ mb/sr, \cite{Fortune:94} $^{10}$Be$(t,p)^{12}$Be(gs) $(\sigma=1.9\pm0.5$ mb, $4.4^\circ\leq\theta_{cm}\leq54.4^\circ)$ as compared to \cite{Schmitt:13} 
 	$^{10}$Be$(d,p)^{11}$Be($1/2^+$) $(\sigma=2.4\pm0.013$ mb, $5^\circ\leq\theta_{cm}\leq39^\circ)$ in the case of light nuclei around closed $(N=6)$ shell, and \cite{Bassani:65} $^{120}$Sn$(p,t)^{118}$Sn(gs) $(\sigma=3.024\pm0.907$ mb, $5^\circ\leq\theta_{cm}\leq40^\circ)$ as compared to \cite{Bechara:75} $^{120}$Sn$(d,p)^{121}$Sn($7/2^+$) $(\sigma=5.2\pm0.6$ mb, $2^\circ\leq\theta_{cm}\leq58^\circ)$.}.
 The above parlance, being at the basis of the Josephson effect, reflects both one of the most solidly established results in the study of BCS pairing, and explains the workings of a paradigmatic probe of spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomena.
 
 
 
Due to the fact that, away from the Fermi energy pair  motion becomes independent particle motion, one-particle transfer reactions like e.g. ($d,p$) and ($p,d$) can be used together with ($t,p$) and ($p,t$) processes, as  valid tools to cross check pair correlation predictions. In particular, to shed light on the origin of pairing in nuclei: in a nutshell, the relative importance of the bare $NN$-interaction and the induced pairing interaction.

While the calculation of two-nucleon transfer spectroscopic amplitudes and differential cross sections are, a priori, more involved to be worked out than those associated with one-nucleon transfer reactions, the former are, as a rule, more ``intrinsically'' accurate than the latter ones. This is because, in the case of two nucleon transfer reactions, the quantity (order parameter $\alpha'_0$) which expresses the collectivity of the members of a pairing rotational band, reflects the properties of a coherent state ($|BCS\rangle$). In other words, it results from the sum over many two-nucleon transfer spectroscopic amplitudes ($\sqrt{j_{\nu}+1/2}\,U'_\nu V'_\nu$), all phased in the same way (phase correlated).

There is a further reason which confers $\alpha'_0=\sum_j(j+1/2)U'_jV'_j$ a privileged position with respect to the single contributions $(j+1/2)U'_jV'_j$. It is the fact that $\alpha'_0=e^{2i\phi}\sum_j(j+1/2)U_jV_j=e^{2i\phi}\alpha_0$ defines a privileged orientation in gauge space, $\alpha_0$ being the order parameter referred to the laboratory system which makes an angle $\phi$ in gauge space with respect to the intrinsic system to which $\alpha'_0$ is referred\footnote{It is of notice that the square root of $\alpha_0=e^{-2i\phi}\alpha_0'$, normalized to a proper volume element $V$, that is, $\Psi=e^{-i\phi}\sqrt{n_S}$, where $n_S=\alpha'_0/V$ is the density of superconducting electrons, constitutes the order parameter at the basis of the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity (\cite{Ginzburg:50}), called by Ginzburg the $\Psi$-theory of superconductivity (\cite{Ginzburg:04}), published seven years before than BCS.}. In other words, the quantities $\alpha'_0$  measures the deformation of the superfluid nuclear system in gauge space. 

Similar arguments can be used regarding the excitation of pairing vibrations in terms of Cooper pair transfer around closed shells as compared to one-particle transfer. As seen from Fig. \ref{fig2.1.5} (c)--(b), the random phase approximation (RPA) amplitudes $X_\nu^a$ and $Y^a_\nu$ are coherently summed over pairs of time reversal states to give rise to the spectroscopic amplitudes associated with the direct excitation of the pair addition mode displayed in (d). Because of the (dispersion) relation (b)+(c)$\equiv$(d), the $X_\nu$- and $Y_\nu$-amplitudes are, in the Cooper pair transfer process, correlated, the situation being not so in the case of one-particle transfer (see e.g. Fig. \ref{fig1.4.2} (e), (f)). In other words, while the (renormalized) spectroscopic amplitude and (renormalized) radial form factor associated with a one-nucleon transfer process depend on a single renormalized energy and associated wavefunction, the corresponding quantities for Cooper pair transfer depend on a distribution of (renormalized) states and  wavefunctions of levels around the Fermi energy, leading to a coherent state\footnote{We note that, in spite of the fact that one is dealing with the connection between structure and direct transfer reactions, no mention has been made of spectroscopic factors in relation with one-particle transfer processes, let alone when discussing two-particle transfer processes.}.

We write now, in somewhat more detail, the spectroscopic amplitudes ($B$-coefficients) for the two-nucleon transfer processes mentioned above. Namely, one for the case in which $A$ and $B(=A+2)$ are members of a pairing rotational band. A second one, for the case in which they are members of a pairing vibrational band. That is, 
\begin{equation}\label{eqC21.8}
\begin{split}
\mathbf{1)}, B((nlj)^2(0))=&\langle BCS(N+2)|\frac{[a^\dagger_{nlj}a^\dagger_{nlj}]^0_0}{\sqrt{2}}|BCS(N)\rangle\\
&=\sqrt{j+1/2}\,U_{nlj}(N)V_{nlj}(N+2),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathbf{2)}, B((nlj)^2(0))=&\langle (N_0+2)(gs)|\frac{[a^\dagger_{nlj}a^\dagger_{nlj}]^0_0}{\sqrt{2}}|N_0(gs)\rangle \\
&\\
&=\left\{\begin{array}{c}
\sqrt{j_k+1/2}\;\;X^a(n_kl_kj_k)\quad (\epsilon_{j_k}>\epsilon_F) \\ 
\sqrt{j_k+1/2}\;\;Y^a(n_il_ij_i)\quad (\epsilon_{j_i}\leq\epsilon_F).
\end{array} \right.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Where the $X$ and $Y$ coefficients are the forwardsgoing and backwardsgoing RPA amplitudes of the pair addition mode.
For actual numerical values, see Tables \ref{tab1D1} and   \ref{tab1E2}--\ref{tab1E5}. Making use of these spectroscopic amplitudes and treating explicitly the intermediate deuteron channel in terms of successive transfer, correcting both this and the simultaneous transfer channels for non-orthogonality contributions, makes the above picture the quantitative probe of Cooper pair correlations in nuclei\footnote{\cite{Bayman:82} and \cite{Potel:13}, see also \cite{Gotz:75} and \cite{Broglia:77b}.}  (Fig. \ref{fig1.5}).

Summing up, one will use throughout the present monograph, exception made when explicitly mentioned, absolute cross sections as the  link between spectroscopic amplitudes and experimental observations\footnote{It is of notice that concerning nuclear structure information, it is also contained in the optical potential used in the calculation of the corresponding cross sections. See footnote \ref{f21c1} Ch. \ref{introduction}.}.

%Concerning the modified formfactor associated with e.g. a ($t,p$) process, we shall see in the (Chapter \ref{C7}, Sect. \ref{C7AppB}) that it can be written as
%\begin{equation}\label{eq1.1.1}
%\begin{split}
%u_{LSJ}^{J_iJ_f}(R)&=\sum_{\substack{n_1l_1j_1\\n_2l_2j_2,n}}B(n_1l_1j_1,n_2l_2j_2;JJ_iJ_f)\\

%&\times\Omega_n R_{NL}(R),

%\end{equation}
%where the overlaps

%\begin{split}
%B&(n_1l_1j_1,n_2l_2j_2;JJ_iJ_f)\\
%=&\langle \Psi^{J_f}(\xi_{A+2})|\left[\phi^J(n_1l_1j_1,n_2l_2j_2),\Psi^{J_i}(\xi_A)\right]^{J_f}\rangle,

%\end{equation}
%and 
%\begin{equation}\label{eq1.1.3}
%\Omega_n=\langle \phi_{nlm_l}(\mathbf r)|\phi_{000}(\mathbf r)\rangle,
%\end{equation}
%encode for the physics of particle--particle (but also, to a large extent, particle--hole) correlations in nuclei, $\langle SLJ|j_1j_2J\rangle$ and $\langle n0,NL,L|n_1 l_1,n_2l_2;L\rangle$ being $LS-jj$ and Moshinsky transformation brackets, keeping track of symmetry and number of degrees of freedom conservation\footnote{\cite{Glendenning:65}, \cite{Broglia:73}.}. In fact, the two--nucleon spectroscopic amplitude (B--coefficient) and the overlap $\Omega_n$ reflect the parentage with which the nucleus $B$ can be written in terms of the system $A$ and a Cooper pair,
%\begin{equation}
%\Psi_{exit}=\Psi_{M_f}^{J_f}(\xi_{A+2})\times\chi^{S_f}_{M_{S_f}}(\sigma_p),
%\end{equation}
%where
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
%\Psi_{M_f}^{J_f}(\xi_{A+2})&=\sum_{\substack{n_1l_1j_1\\n_2l_2j_2\\J,J'_i}}B(n_1l_1j_1,n_2l_2j_2;JJ'_iJ_f)\\
%&\times\left[\phi^J(n_1l_1j_1,n_2l_2j_2)\Psi^{J'_i}(\xi_A)\right]_{M_f}^{J_f},

%\phi_t=\left[\chi^S(\sigma_{n1},\sigma_{n2})\chi^{S'_f}(\sigma_p)
%\right]_{M_{S_i}}^{S_i}\times\phi_t^{L=0}\Big(\sum_{i>j}|\mathbf r_i-\mathbf r_j|\Big).
%\end{equation}
%Assuming for simplicity a symmetric di--neutron radial wavefunction for the triton  (i.e. neglecting the $d$--component of the corresponding wavefunction) both for the relative and for the center of mass wavefunctions $\phi_{nlm}(\mathbf{r})$ and $\phi_{N\Lambda M}(R)$ ($n=l=m=0, N=\Lambda=M=0$), leads to $\Omega_n$, a quantity which reflects both the non--orthogonality existing between the di--neutron wavefunctions in the final nucleus (Cooper pair) and in the triton as well as their degree of $s$--wave of relative motion. Another way to say the same thing is to state that dineutron correlations in these two systems are different, a fact which underscores the limitations of  light ion reactions to probe specifically pairing correlations in nuclei\footnote{Within this context see  \cite{vonOertzen:01}, \cite{Oertzen:13}.}.
%
%
%One can then conclude that, provided one makes use of a (sensible) complete single--particle basis (eventually including also the continuum), one can capture through $u_{LSJ}^{J_iJ_f}(R)$ most of the coherence of Cooper pair transfer, as a major fraction of the associated di--neutron non--locality is taken care of by the n--summation appearing in Eq. (\ref{eq1.1.1}), the different contributions being weighted by the non--orthogonality overlaps $\Omega_n$. This is in keeping with the fact that, making use of a more refined triton wavefunction than that employed above, the $n-p$ (deuteron--like) correlations of this particle can be described with reasonable accuracy and thus, the emergence of successive transfer (see Chapter \ref{chapter2}). On the other hand, being the deuteron a bound system, this effective treatment of the associated resonances is not particularly economic. Furthermore, it is of notice that the zero--range approximation ($V(\rho)\phi_{000}(\rho)=D_0\delta(\vec \rho)$) eliminates the above mentioned possibilities (cf. Eq. (\ref{5lec19})).
%
%Anyhow, the fact that one can still work out a detailed and physically insightful picture of two--nucleon transfer reactions in nuclei in terms of absolute cross sections with the help of a single parameter ($D_0^2\approx(31.6\pm 9.3)10^4 \text{MeV}^2\text{fm}^2$) testifies to the fact that the above picture of Cooper pair transfer\footnote{\cite{Glendenning:65}, \cite{Bayman:67}.} is a useful one, as it contains an important fraction of the physics which is at the basis of Cooper pair transfer in nuclei\footnote{\cite{Broglia:73}.}. This is in keeping with the fact that the Cooper pair correlation length is much larger than nuclear dimensions and, consequently, simultaneous and successive transfer feel the same pairing correlations (see Chapter \ref{chapter2}).

\section{Renormalization and spectroscopic amplitudes}\label{S3.2}
As a result of the interweaving of single-particle and collective motion, the nucleons acquire a state dependent self energy $\Delta E_j(\omega)$.   Consequently, the single-particle potential which was already non-local in space (exchange potential, related to the Pauli principle) becomes also non-local in time. A possible technique to make it local is that of the effective mass approximation. In it  one  describes the single-particle motion in terms of a local potential  given by $U'(r)=(m/m^*)U(r)$. The quantity $m^*=m_km_\omega/m$ is the effective nucleon mass, $m_k$ being the so-called $k$-mass associated with the Fock potential, and $m_\omega=m(1+\lambda)$ being the $\omega$-mass (non-locality in time, as implied by the relation $\Delta \omega\Delta t\geq1$). The quantity  $\lambda=-\partial \Delta E(\omega)/\partial \hbar \omega$ is the so-called mass enhancement factor. It reflects the ability with which vibrations dress single-particles. In other words, it measures the probability with which a nucleon moving at  $t=-\infty$ in a ``pure'' orbital $j$ can be found at a later time in a 2$p-1h$ like (doorway state) $|j'L;j\rangle$, $L$ being the multipolarity of a vibrational state. Within this context, the discontinuity taking place at the Fermi energy in the dressed particle picture ($Z_\omega=(m/m_\omega)$) reflects the associated single-particle occupancy probability\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Brink:05} Ch. 9.}.


It is of notice that dressed particles  imply also an induced pairing interaction $v_p^{ind}$ which renormalizes the bare $NN$-$^1S_0$ interaction $v_p^{bare}$, and results  from the exchange of the dressing vibrations between pairs of nucleons moving in time reversal states close to the Fermi energy\footnote{See e.g. Fig. \ref{fig3_A_3},  \ref{fig6G1} (II) (b),(d),(e).}. \textit{In other words, fluctuations in the normal density $\delta \rho$ and the associated $\delta U$ (Time-Dependent HF) and associated particle-vibration coupling vertices lead to abnormal (pairing) density}. Whether this results in  a dynamic or static phenomenon, depends on whether the parameter (see Fig. \ref{fig1_E8}\footnote{\cite{Brink:05} App. H. Sect. H4 and refs. therein; \cite{Barranco:05}.}) 
\begin{align}\label{eq2_1_10}
x'=G'N'(0),  
\end{align}
product of the effective pairing strength, 
\begin{align}\label{eq2_2_2}
G'=Z_\omega^2(v_p^{bare}+v_p^{ind}),
\end{align}
and of the renormalized density of levels $N'(0)$ is considerable smaller  (larger) than $\approx1/2$. The quantity $G'$ is the sum of the bare and induced pairing interaction, renormalized by the degree of single-particle content of the levels in which nucleons correlate. The quantity 
\begin{align}
N'(0)=Z_\omega^{-1}N(0)=(1+\lambda)N(0)
\end{align}
is the similarly renormalized density of levels at the Fermi energy. From the above relations one obtains 
\begin{align}
x'=Z_\omega(v_p^{bare}+v_p^{ind})N(0).
\end{align}
It is of notice that typical values of $Z_\omega\approx0.7$, while for nuclei along the stability valley bare and induced pairing contributions are about equal which, according to Eq. (\ref{eq2_2_2}) implies $G'\approx G=v^{bare}_p$, as in the case of a non-renormalized situation. On the other hand the physics is radically different, particles being a consistent fraction of the time in excited states coupled to collective vibrations, pairing acquiring a state dependence. 
 
All of the above many-body, $\omega$-dependent effects which imply in many cases a coherent sum of amplitudes, together with the corresponding renormalizations of the single-particle radial wavefunctions (formfactors) not discussed within the present framework, are not simple to capture in a spectroscopic factor\footnote{In keeping with the fact that $m_k\approx 0.6-0.7 m$ and that $m^*\approx m$, as testified by the satisfactory fitting standard Saxon-Woods potentials provides for the valence orbitals of nucleons of mass $m$ around closed shells, one obtains $m_\omega\approx 1.4-1.7 m$. Thus $Z_\omega \approx 0.6-0.7$. It is still an open question how much of the observed single--particle depopulation can be due to hard core effects, which shifts the associated strength to high momentum levels (see \cite{Dickhoff:05}, \cite{Jenning:11}, \cite{Kramer:01}, \cite{Barbieri:09}, \cite{Schiffer:12}, \cite{Duguet:12}, \cite{Furnstahl:10}).  An estimate of such an effect of about 20\% will not quantitative change the long wavelength estimate of $Z_\omega$ given above. Arguably, a much larger depopulation through hard core effects remains an open problem within the overall picture of elementary modes of nuclear excitation and of medium polarization effects. Within this context it remains an open question  the role   the renormalization of the radial dependence of the single-particle wavefunctions (form factors), due to many-body effects, can play in the determination of spectroscopic factors. Discussions with Augusto Macchiavelli on this subject are gratefully acknowledged.} neither in connection with one-particle transfer, nor regarding two-nucleon transfer processes\footnote{See \cite{Barranco:05,Barranco:99}.}.

 \end{figure}
The quantality parameter\footnote{\cite{Nosanow:76}, \cite{deBoer:57}, \cite{deBoer:48}, \cite{deBoer:48b},\cite{Mottelson:02}.} is defined as the ratio of the quantal kinetic energy of localization (confinement) and the potential energy, (cf. Fig. \ref{fig1A1} and Table \ref{tab1A1}).
 Fluctuations, quantal or classical, favor symmetry: gases and liquids are homogeneous. Potential energy on the other hand prefers special arrangements: atoms like to be at specific distances and orientations from each other (spontaneous breaking of translational and of rotational symmetry reflecting the homogeneity and isotropy of empty space\footnote{As already stated in footnote \ref{f1C3} of this Chapter, within such a  general context, the physics embodied in the quantality parameter is closely related to that which is at the basis of the classical Lindemann criterion (\cite{Lindemann:10}) to measure whether a system is ordered (e.g. a crystal) or disordered (e.g. a melted system) (\cite{Bilgram:87}, \cite{Lowen:94}, \cite{Stillinger:90,Stillinger:95}). The above statement concerning the competition between potential energy and fluctuations,  is also valid for the generalized Lindemann parameter (\cite{Stillinger:90}, \cite{Zhou:99}), used to provide similar insight into inhomogeneous finite systems like e.g. proteins (aperiodic crystals \cite{Schrodinger:44}, see also Ehrenfest's theorem (\cite{Basdevant:05} pag. 138 see also App. \ref{C2AppC}).}).
 
 
  When $q$ is small, quantal effects are small and the lower state for $T<T_c$ will be a solid  (crystalline structure), $T_c$ denoting the critical temperature.  For sufficiently large values of $q\, (>0.15$) the system will display particle delocalization and,  likely, be  amenable, within some approximation, to a mean field description (Figs. \ref{fig1.0.6} and   \ref{fig1A3}). In fact, the step \textit{delocalization $\rightarrow$ mean field} is  not automatic, neither guaranteed. In any case, not for all properties neither for all levels of the system. Let us elaborate on these points. 
  
  
  As already stated, independent particle motion can be viewed as the most collective of all nuclear properties, reflecting the effect of all nucleons on a given one resulting in a macroscopic effect. Consequently, it should be possible to calculate the mean field in an accurate manner. Arguably, as accurately as one can calculate collective vibrations, e.g. quadrupole vibrations. But this does not mean that one knows how to correctly calculate the energy and associated dynamical deformation parameter of each single state of the quadrupole response function. Within this context one may find, through mean field approximation a good description for the energy of the valence orbitals of a nucleus but for  specific levels (e.g. the $d_{5/2}$ level of the isotopes $^{119-120}$Sn, see Fig \ref{fig6.2.3}). It is not said that  including  particle-vibration coupling corrections, a process which in average makes theory come closer to experiment\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Bohr:75}, \cite{Bohr:77}, \cite{Hamamoto:77}, \cite{Bes:77c}, \cite{Barnes:72}, \cite{Reich:74}, \cite{Hamamoto:76}, \cite{Bortignon:77}, \cite{Bernard:81}, \cite{Mahaux:85}, \cite{Bes:71,Flynn:71}, \cite{Bortignon:76}, \cite{Bes:88}, \cite{Barranco:87b}, \cite{Vinh:95}, \cite{Barranco:01,Orrigo:09} and references therein.}, single specific quasiparticle energies will satisfactorily agree  with the data\footnote{See \cite{Tarpanov:14}.}. Cases like this one constitute a sobering experience concerning the intricacies of the many-body problem in general, and of the nuclear one (finite many-body system, FMBS) in particular, where spatial quantization plays a central role. In other words, one is dealing with a self-bound, strongly interacting, finite many-body system generated from collisions originally associated  with a variety of astrophysical events and thus with  the coupling and interweaving of different scattering channels and resonances, a little bit as e.g. the Hoyle monopole resonance ($\alpha+\alpha+\alpha\rightarrow^{12}$C). Within the anthropomorphic  scenario such phenomena are found in the evolution of the Universe to eventually allow for the presence of organic matter and, arguably, life on earth\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Rees:00}, \cite{Meissner:15} and references therein.} more likely than to make mean field approximation, also the renormalized one, an ``exact'' description of nuclear structure and reactions, for every single nuclear level.

 \section{Generalized quantality parameter}\label{App1D}
 Remaining within the framework of independent particle motion, but allowing for the dressing of particles one obtains a sygmoidal distribution around the Fermi energy reflecting the $\omega$-dependence of $Z_\nu(\omega)$. In the case of the Sn-isotopes where the density of levels is $N(0)\approx 4$MeV$^{-1}$ and the energy of the lowest $\beta=0$ collective vibration ($\lambda^\pi=2^+$) is $\hbar\omega_2\approx1.3$ MeV, one expects the width of the distribution to be $\approx3$ MeV around the Fermi energy. Allowing nucleons not only to emit and reabsorb $\beta=0$ vibrational modes, but also to exchange them with the other nucleons, as well as to interact through $v_{p}^{bare}$, one is confronted with a many-body problem like the one discussed in Sect. \ref{S3.2}  fo $x\gg1/2$,  which can be solved at profit within the BCS framework. It leads, again for Sn-isotopes, to a sigmoidal occupation probability extending over an energy range also of $\approx 3$ MeV ($\approx 2\Delta$) around the Fermi energy\footnote{Within this context see discussion following Eqs. (\ref{eq1.4.58}) and (\ref{eq1.4.57}) and \cite{Tinkham:96}.}. 
 
 
 In spite of the similitudes in occupancy between the two physical situations discussed above, the associated $L=0$ (gs)$\to$(gs) two-nucleon transfer cross sections are quite different. In the first case, it is proportional to $(Z_{\nu_1}\sqrt{\sigma_{\nu_1}})^2\approx(1/2)\times\sigma_{\nu_1}$ and to $(\sum_{\nu>0}U_{\nu}'V_{\nu}'\sqrt{\sigma_\nu})^2\approx(\alpha_0')^2\bar\sigma\approx50\times\bar\sigma$ in the second. The quantity $\sigma_{\nu_1}$ is the cross section associated with the lowest $ j_{\nu_1}^2(0)$ two-particle configuration. The summation $\sum_{\nu>0}$ extends over the orbitals around $\epsilon_F$ within a range $\approx2\Delta$, and $\bar\sigma$ is the average of the cross sections $\sigma_\nu$ associated with the valence configurations $j^2_\nu(0)$.
 
 In connection with the Cooper pair (BCS solution) one should,
  more correctly, use the wavefunction (\ref{eq0.1.101}) to calculate the two-nucleon transfer cross section. In keeping with the definition $c'_\nu=V'_\nu/U'_\nu$ ad the phasing (\ref{eq0.1.76}), it is found that
\begin{align}\label{eq3.4.1}
	\sum_{\nu>0}c'_\nu P_\nu^\dagger\ket{0}_F=e^{2i\phi}\sum_{\nu>0}c_\nu P_\nu^\dagger\ket{0}_F,
\end{align}
leading to,
 \begin{align}\label{eq3.4.2}
\ket{\Psi_{N_1}}\sim\left(e^{2i\phi}\sum_{\nu>0}c_\nu P^\dagger_\nu\right)^{N_1/2}\ket{0}_F.
 \end{align}
 That is, independent pair motion, each Cooper pair contributing a phase $\phi$ to $\ket{N}$.
 
 
 Note that in a metallic superconductor as described by BCS, there are of the order of $10^6$ Cooper pairs around the Fermi surface. Because the phase $\phi$ is common to so many pairs, its effects can become felt on the macroscopic scale.By the same token, the quantal behaviour of the BCS condensate must also be the same as the quantal behaviour of a single Cooper pair. A feature which reflects itself in superfluid nuclei, although in this case one is talking of only 6--8 Cooper pairs.  
 
 
 
 If one finds, as one does\footnote{\cite{Josephson:62,Anderson:63}.}, that the tunneling energy is a function of the relative phase, it will adjust so as to minimize the energy through tunneling of electrons.  The generalized quantality parameter, ratio of the kinetic energy of confinement $(T_\xi=\hbar^2/(2m_e\xi^2)\approx4\times10^{-5}$meV; $\xi\approx10^4)$ of the electrons forming the Cooper pairs undergoing tunneling, and the Cooper pair correlation (binding) energy $E_{corr}(\approx3$ meV, $\Delta\approx1.4$ meV, Pb), is much smaller than 1 $ (q_\xi\approx10^{-5})$. A result which implies that for $T<T_c(T_c\approx7.1$ K, critical temperature of Pb), the electron Cooper pair partners are solidly anchored to each other. Said it differently, the intrinsic Cooper pair motion is frozen because of the pairing gap. Consequently, if under such conditions ($T<T_c$) one observes a current across the unbiased junction between the two superconductors, it must be a current of carriers of mass $2m_e$ and charge $2e$. If one electron partner of a Cooper pair tunnels, the other entangled electron does it also. 
 The parallel between independent-particle and independent-Cooper pair motion, all with the same phase, is summarized in\footnote{In connection with  Fig. \ref{fig1D2}, the estimate $R=8/k_F$ was carried out with the help of the Fermi gas model (see e.g. \cite{Bohr:69}, for $A\approx120$). The Fermi momentum is written as $k_F\approx (3\pi^2 A/2V)^{1/3}\approx (\frac{3\pi^2}{2}\rho(0))^{1/3}$. It is of notice that this expression leads for $\rho(0)\approx 0.17$ fm $^{-3}$ to the Fermi momentum $k_F\approx 1.36 $ fm$^{-1}$.} Fig. \ref{fig1D2}. \textit{It is of notice that in the present case this result emerges not because of the large role played by potential effects, but because of the very large dimensions, low relative intrinsic momentum of the Cooper pair.}

We conclude this section by remarking once more that BCS condensation, that is condensation of strongly overlapping, very extended, weakly bound Cooper pairs corresponds to ordering in occupying momentum space, and not space-like condensation of strongly bound clusters which undergo Bose condensation. In BCS condensation, the inner, intrinsic structure of the pair, that is, the fact that it is made out of fermions entangled in time reversal states, is the characterizing feature, at the basis of ODLRO. Cooper pairs (see Eqs. (\ref{eq0.1.82}) and (\ref{eq3.4.1})) are not bosons, as $(P_\nu^{\dagger})^2=0$ testifies (see also App. \ref{App3E}). However, it is true that, under certain circumstances, namely $T<T_c$, $q\ll1/\xi$ and $d\ll\xi$ ($D_0\lesssim\xi$ in the case of heavy ion reactions between superfluid nuclei), where $\xi$ is the correlation length and $d$ is the width of the  Josephson junction ($D_0$ being the distance of closest approach), Cooper pairs show properties which strongly resemble those of bosons\footnote{\cite{terHaar:95b}, \cite{TerHaar:95} Ch. 4.9 and \cite{Ehrenfest:31}.}.






\section[Pair vibration spectroscopic amplitudes]{Two-nucleon spectroscopic amplitudes associated with pairing vibrational modes in closed shell systems: the $^{208}$Pb case.}\label{App1E}
The solution of the pairing Hamiltonian
leads, in the case of closed shell systems and within the harmonic approximation (RPA), to pair addition $(a)$ pair removal $(r)$ two-particle, two-hole correlated modes. The associated creation  operator have been defined in Eqs. (\ref{eq1.0.34})--(\ref{eq1.0.36})
for the pair addition mode. Similarly, in the case of the pair removal mode, 
\begin{equation*}
\Gamma_r^\dagger(n)=\sum_i X_n^r(i)\Gamma_i^\dagger+\sum_kY^r_n(k)\Gamma_k,
\end{equation*}
$X,Y$ fulfilling
\begin{equation*}
\sum X^2-Y^2=1,
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
\Gamma_k^\dagger=a_k^\dagger a_{\tilde k}^\dagger,\quad (\epsilon_k>\epsilon_F).
\end{equation*}
Similarly,
\begin{equation*}
\Gamma_i^\dagger=a_{\tilde i} a_i ,\quad (\epsilon_i\leq\epsilon_F).
\end{equation*}
The relations
\begin{equation*}
[H,\Gamma_a^\dagger(n)]=\hbar W_n (\beta=+2),
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
[H,\Gamma_r^\dagger(n)]=\hbar W_n (\beta=-2),
\end{equation*}
where $\beta$ is the transfer quantum number, lead to the dispersion relations, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq3.5.1}
\frac{1}{G(\pm2)}=\sum_k \frac{(\Omega_k/2)}{2\epsilon_k\mp W_n(\pm2)}+\sum_i \frac{(\Omega_i/2)}{2\epsilon_i\pm W_n(\pm2)},
\end{equation}
$n$ labeling the corresponding solutions in increasing order of energy. In the above equation, $\Omega_j=j+1/2$ is the pair degeneracy of the orbital with total angular momentum $j$.

For the case of the (neutron) pair addition and pair substraction modes of $^{208}$Pb the above equations are  graphically solved in Fig \ref{fig1E1} (see also Table \ref{tab1E1}). The minimum of the dispersion relation defines the Fermi energy of the system under study. This is in keeping with the fact that \textit{in the case in which $W_1 (\beta=+2)=W_1(\beta=-2)=0$, situation corresponding to the  transition between normal and superfluid phases\footnote{See footnote \ref{f25Ch1} Ch. \ref{introduction}.}}, the energy value at which the dispersion relation touches for the first time the energy axis, coincides with the BCS $\lambda$ variational parameter. It is of notice that, as a rule, the Fermi energy of closed shell nuclei is empirically defined as half the energy difference between the last occupied and the first empty single particle state\footnote{cf. e.g. \cite{Mahaux:85}.}. Making use of the values

The first one from the left corresponds to the pairing correlation energy of the nucleus $^{206}$Pb (two correlated neutron hole states) while the last segment to the right measures the pairing correlation energy of $^{210}$Pb (two correlated neutrons above closed shell) the intermediate segment measures the energy of the two phonon (correlated ($2p-2h$)) pairing vibrational state  of $^{208}$Pb.}\label{fig1E1}

 \begin{equation*}
 \left\{
 \begin{array}{c}
  E_{corr}(+2)=BE(208)+BE(210)-2BE(209)=1.248\,\text{MeV},\\ 
  E_{corr}(-2)=BE(208)+BE(206)-2BE(207)=0.640\,\text{MeV},
 \end{array}
 \right.
 \end{equation*}
 one obtains
 $W_1(-2)+W_1(+2)=(BE(208)-BE(206))-(BE(210)-BE(208))$
 $=14.11-9.115=4.995 \,\text{MeV}$. Notice that in the above calculations all energies differences are positive. In particular (see Table \ref{tab1E1})  
\begin{equation*}
\epsilon_i<\epsilon_F\Rightarrow \epsilon_F-\epsilon_i=-|\epsilon_F|+|\epsilon_i|=|\epsilon_i|-|\epsilon_F|>0,
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
\epsilon_k>\epsilon_F\Rightarrow \epsilon_k-\epsilon_F=-|\epsilon_k|+|\epsilon_F|=|\epsilon_F|-|\epsilon_k|>0.
\end{equation*}
Thus,
\begin{equation*}
\left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 2(\epsilon_F-\epsilon_{p_{1/2}})=W_1(-2)+E_{corr}(-2)>0,\\ 
 2(\epsilon_{g_{9/2}}-\epsilon_F)=W_1(+2)+E_{corr}(+2)>0.
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation*}
From Fig. \ref{fig1E1} and Table \ref{tab1E1} one can then write,
\begin{equation*} 
2\times(-5.825-(-7.15))\,\text{MeV}=2.650\,\text{MeV}=W_1(-2)+0.640\,\text{MeV}
\end{equation*}
and 
\begin{equation*} 
2\times(-3.74\, \text{MeV}-(-5.825)\,\text{MeV})=4.17\, \text{MeV}=W_1(+2)+1.248\, \text{MeV}.
\end{equation*}
Consequently,
\begin{equation*} 
W_1(-2)=2.01\,\text{MeV}\quad \text{and} \quad W_1(+2)=2.92\,\text{MeV},
\end{equation*}
leading to,
\begin{equation}\label{eq2.5.1} 
W_1(+2)+W_1(-2)=4.93\,\text{MeV}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Pair removal mode}\
In Fig. \ref{fig1E2}, a graphical representation of the forwards going RPA amplitude of the pair removal mode is shown. Its expression for $n=1$, is 
\begin{equation*}
X_1^r(i)=\frac{\frac{1}{2}\Omega_i^{1/2}\Lambda_1(-2)}{2(\epsilon_F-\epsilon_i)-W_1(-2)},
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
2\times(\epsilon_F-\epsilon_i)-W_1(-2)&=2\times(\epsilon_F-\epsilon_i)-2\times(\epsilon_F-\epsilon_{p_{1/2}})+E_{corr}(-2)\\
&=2\times(\epsilon_{p_{1/2}}-\epsilon_i)+E_{corr}(-2)=2\times(|\epsilon_i|-|\epsilon_{p_{1/2}}|)+E_{corr}(-2).
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Thus,
\begin{equation*}
X_1^r(i)=\frac{\frac{1}{2}\Omega_i^{1/2}\Lambda_1(-2)}{2(|\epsilon_i|-|\epsilon_{p_{1/2}}|)+E_{corr}(-2)}.
\end{equation*}
Making use of the empirical value of $E_{corr}(-2)$ worked out above one obtains, 
  \begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics*[width=0.1\textwidth,angle=0]{nutshell/figs/removal_forward.pdf}}
  \caption{NFT representation of the forwards going RPA amplitude of the pair removal mode (double downward going arrowed line) describing a two correlated hole state (single downward going arrowed line for each hole with quantum numbers collectively labeled $i$).}\label{fig1E2}
  \end{figure}
\begin{equation*}
X_1^r(i)=\frac{\frac{1}{2}\Omega_i^{1/2}\Lambda_1(-2)}{2(|\epsilon_i|-|\epsilon_{p_{1/2}}|)+0.640\,\text{MeV}}.
\end{equation*}
In Fig. \ref{fig1E3} we display the graphical process associated with the backwards going ($n=1$) RPA amplitude,
\begin{equation*}
Y_1^r(k)=\frac{\frac{1}{2}\Omega_k^{1/2}\Lambda_1(-2)}{2(\epsilon_k-\epsilon_F)+W_1(-2)}.
\end{equation*}
  \begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics*[width=0.2\textwidth,angle=0]{nutshell/figs/removal_backward.pdf}}
  \caption{Same as Fig. \ref{fig1E2} but for the backwards going amplitudes.}\label{fig1E3}
  \end{figure}
  Making use of

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
2\times(\epsilon_F&-\epsilon_{p_{1/2}})-E_{corr}(-2)=W_1(-2),
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
one can write
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
2\times(\epsilon_F-\epsilon_{p_{1/2}})+2\times(\epsilon_k-\epsilon_{F})-E_{corr}(-2)=2\times(\epsilon_k-\epsilon_{F})+W_1(-2),
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
leading to 
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
2\times(|\epsilon_{p_{1/2}}|-|\epsilon_k|)-E_{corr}(-2)=2\times(|\epsilon_{p_{1/2}}|-|\epsilon_{g_{9/2}}|)+2\times(|\epsilon_{g_{9/2}}|-|\epsilon_k|)-E_{corr}(-2).
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Thus, 
\begin{equation*}
Y_1^r(k)=\frac{\frac{1}{2}\Omega_k^{1/2}\Lambda_1(-2)}{2(|\epsilon_{g_{9/2}}|-|\epsilon_k|)+2(|\epsilon_{p_{1/2}}|-|\epsilon_{g_{9/2}}|)-E_{corr}(-2)}.
\end{equation*}
With the help of  $2\times(|\epsilon_{p_{1/2}}|-|\epsilon_{g_{9/2}}|)-E_{corr}(-2)=6.82 \text{MeV}-0.640 \text{MeV}=6.18 \text{MeV}$, one obtains,
\begin{equation*}
Y_1^r(k)=\frac{\frac{1}{2}\Omega_k^{1/2}\Lambda_1(-2)}{2(|\epsilon_{g_{9/2}}|-|\epsilon_k|)+6.18\,\text{MeV}}.
\end{equation*}
The above  expressions of $X_1^r(i)$ and $Y_1^r(k)$ contain the experimental values of the $2$--hole correlation energies (0.640 MeV). Because (see Fig. \ref{fig1E1}) the associated values of $G$ does not lead to the observed correlation energy of the pair addition mode (1.248 MeV), we prefer to choose a single value of $G$ and use the resulting $E_{corr}(-2)$ (=0.5 MeV) and $E_{corr}(+2)$ (=1.5 MeV), correlation energies, to calculate the corresponding $X,Y$ amplitudes for both the lowest removal and lowest addition pairing modes. Making use of, 
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
2\times(|\epsilon_{p_{1/2}}|-|\epsilon_{g_{9/2}}|)=6.82\,\text{MeV}\quad\text{and}\quad 2&\times(|\epsilon_{p_{1/2}}|-|\epsilon_{g_{9/2}}|)-E_{corr}(-2)\\
&=(6.82-0.5)\,\text{MeV}=6.32\,\text{MeV},
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
one can write
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
X_1^r(i)&=\frac{\frac{1}{2}\Omega_i^{1/2}\Lambda_1(-2)}{2(|\epsilon_i|-|\epsilon_{p_{1/2}}|)+0.5\,\text{MeV}},\\ Y_1^r(k)&=\frac{\frac{1}{2}\Omega_k^{1/2}\Lambda_1(-2)}{2(|\epsilon_{g_{9/2}}|-|\epsilon_k|)+6.32\,\text{MeV}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Tables \ref{tab1E2} and \ref{tab1E3} contain the amplitudes of the pair removal mode of $^{208}$Pb ($\Gamma^\dagger_r(1)=\sum X^r_{1}(i)\Gamma^\dagger_i+\sum Y^r_{1}(k)\Gamma_k$), that is of the two neutron  correlated hole state describing $|^{206}\text{Pb (gs)}\rangle=\Gamma^\dagger_r(1)|0\rangle$. 


It is of notice that the coupling strength $\Lambda_1 (-2)$ with which the pair removal mode couples to the two single-particles (-holes) states is calculated by normalizing the amplitudes: \textbf{1}) Tamm Dancoff, TD implies no ground state correlations\footnote{See footnote \ref{f25Ch1} Ch. \ref{introduction}.}, i.e. to assume that $Y\equiv0$) $\sum_iA^2(i)=1.5549 \,\text{MeV}^{-2}$ and thus $\Lambda_1 (-2)=0.802$ MeV, ($\sum X(i)^2_{TD}=1$); \textbf{2}) RPA, $\Lambda_1^2 (-2)\times(\sum_i A^2(i)-\sum_k B^2(k))=\Lambda_1^2(-2)\times1.45073=1$. Thus $\Lambda_1(-2)=0.830$ MeV.


 The above results show that there is a few percentage difference between the two values of $\Lambda$ (TD and RPA), as well as for the corresponding $X$ amplitudes (Table \ref{tab1E2}). Nonetheless, ground state correlations as expressed by the $Y$ amplitudes (Table \ref{tab1E3}), gives rise to a 53\% increase in the $^{206}$Pb$(t,p)^{208}$Pb(gs) absolute cross section, from 0.34 mb to 0.52 mb to be compared with experimental data $\sigma=0.68\pm 0.24$ mb (see Fig. \ref{fig2A4}).

Let us conclude this Section by noting that while the harmonic (RPA) description of the pair vibrational mode of $^{208}$Pb provides a fair picture of the two neutron transfer spectroscopic amplitudes, in keeping with the collective character of these (coherent) states, conspicuous anharmonicities in the multi--phonon spectrum have been observed and calculated\footnote{Cf. for example \cite{Flynn:72}, \cite{Lanford:73}, \cite{Bortignon:78}; \cite{Clark:06}.}. Within the framework of Fig. \ref{fig1D1}, we schematically emphasize in Fig. \ref{fig1_E8} the relative importance of dynamic and static pairing distortions, in comparison with the corresponding quantities in the case of quadrupole surface distortions in 3D--space\footnote{For details cf. \cite{Bes:77}, \cite{Broglia:68}, \cite{Bes:88},\cite{Barranco:87a} \cite{Shimizu:89}, \cite{Shimizu:13}, \cite{Vaquero:13} and references therein.}  These results underscore the major role pairing vibrations play in nuclei around closed shells, while those shown in Fig. \ref{fig1.2} emphasize their importance in gauge invariance restoration in systems far away from closed shells.

\section[Halo pair addition mode and pygmy]{Halo pair addition and pygmy dipole modes: a new mechanism to break gauge invariance}\label{App1AF}
Pairing correlations are  intimately connected with particle number violation and thus spontaneous breaking of gauge invariance, as testified by the order parameter\\ \mbox{$\langle BCS|P^{\dagger}|BCS\rangle=\alpha_0$}.  In the nuclear case and, at variance with condensed matter, dynamical breaking of gauge symmetry is similarly important to that associated with static distortions. The fact that the average single-particle potential acts as an external field  is one of the reasons for the existence of a critical value $G_c$ of the pairing strength $G$ to bind Cooper pairs in nuclei. Spatial quantization in finite systems at large and in nuclei in particular, is intimately connected with the paramount role the surface plays in these systems\footnote{See \cite{Bohr:75}; see also \cite{Broglia:02d} and references therein.}. Another consequence of this role is  the fact that in nuclei an important fraction ($\approx$50\% in the case of nuclei lying along the stability valley and even more, up to 80\%, for light halo nuclei) of Cooper pair binding is due to the exchange of collective vibrations between the  pair partners\footnote{\label{f53C3} See \cite{Barranco:99}, \cite{Terasaki:02a}, \cite{Brink:05}, \cite{Saperstein:12}, \cite{Avdenkov:12}, \cite{Lombardo:12};  \cite{Barranco:01}, \cite{Potel:10}, \cite{Pankratov:11}, \citet{Barranco:99}; cf. also \cite{Bohr:75}, p. 432.}, the rest being associated with the bare $NN$-interaction in the $^1S_0$ channel (see Fig. \ref{fig1F1}) plus possible $3N$ corrections\footnote{See footnote \ref{f9} Ch. \ref{introduction}.}. 


The study of light exotic nuclei lying along the neutron drip line have revealed a novel aspect of the interplay between shell effects and induced pairing interaction. It has been found  that there are situations in which spatial quantization screens, essentially completely, the bare nucleon-nucleon paring interaction. This happens in the case in which the nuclear valence orbitals are $s,p$-states at threshold\footnote{Pairing anti-halo effect; \cite{Bennaceur:00} 
, \cite{Hamamoto:03}, \cite{Hamamoto:04}.}. An example of situations of this type is provided by some of the $N=7$ isotones, in particular $^{10}_3$Li and, to some extent, $^{11}_4$Be. Nuclei which display ``\textit{parity inversion}'' in the sequence of single-particle levels $1p_{1/2}$ and $2s_{1/2}$ as compared to the Mayer-Jensen prediction (Fig. \ref{fig1.0.3}).
 In what follows we discuss the (unbound) nucleus $^{10}$Li (see also Sect. \ref{S5.2.4}), in connection with the (bound) two-neutron halo system $^{11}$Li.
 
  The $N=7$ isotone $^{10}$Li displays a virtual $s_{1/2}$ and a resonant $p_{1/2}$ state\footnote{See  \cite{Barranco:20}, \cite{Moro:19} and refs. therein, as well as footnotes \ref{f5.28},   \ref{f5.29}  and \ref{f29C5} of Ch. \ref{C6}.}. Let us elaborate on this point. 
The binding provided by a contact pairing interaction $V_\delta (|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|)$ ($\delta$-force) to a pair of fermions moving in time--reversal states in a single $j$-shell\footnote{cf. e.g. Eq. (2.12) \cite{Brink:05}.} is given by the matrix element,
\begin{equation}
M_j=\langle j^2(0)|V_\delta|j^2(0)\rangle=-\frac{(2j+1)}{2} V_0 I(j)\approx -\frac{(2j+1)}{2}V_0\frac{3}{R^3}.
\end{equation} 
It is of notice that $G=V_0I(j)$ ($\approx 25/A$ MeV$\approx 2.3$ MeV ($A=11$)). 
The ratio of the above matrix element associated with the two halo neutrons of $^{11}$Li and with an hypothetical normal nucleus of mass $A=11$ is
\begin{equation}\label{eq3.6.2}
r=\frac{(M_j)_{halo}}{(M_j)_{core}}=\frac{2}{(2j+1)}\left(\frac{R_0}{R}\right)^3.
\end{equation}
The quantities $R_0=1.2 A^{1/3}$fm$=2.7$fm ($A=11$), and $R=\sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}\langle r^2\rangle^{1/2}_{^{11}\text{Li}}=\sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}(3.55\pm0.1)$ fm =$(4.58\pm 0.13)$ fm are the radius of a  nucleus of mass $A=11$ (systematics), and  the measured (mean square) radius of $^{11}$Li, respectively. The quantity $j$ is the effective angular momentum of a single $j$--shell which can accommodate 8 neutrons $(j\sim k_F R_0\approx 1.36 \text{ fm}^{-1}\times2.7\text{ fm}\approx3.7)$. One thus obtains
\begin{align}\label{eq2.6.3}
r=0.048.
\end{align}
 Consequently, the bare $NN$-nucleon pairing interaction is expected to become strongly screened, the resulting effective $G$-value ($A\approx11$) 
\begin{equation}\label{eq1C2AppF}
G_{scr}=r\times G=0.048\times 25 \text{MeV}/A\approx 1 \text{MeV}/A\approx 0.1\,\text{MeV},
\end{equation}
becoming subcritical and thus unable to bind the halo Cooper pair ($2\tilde \epsilon_{s_{1/2}}=0.3$ MeV, see Fig. \ref{fig1.9.1}) to the $^9$Li core.


 Further insight into this question can be shed making use of the multipole expansion of a general interaction
\begin{equation}
v(|\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf r_2|)=\sum_{\lambda}V_{\lambda}(r_1,r_2)P_\lambda(\cos\theta_{12}).
\end{equation}
Because the function $P_\lambda$ drops from its maximum at $\theta_{12}=0$ in an angular distance $1/\lambda$, particles 1 and 2 interact through the component $\lambda$ of the force, only if $r_{12}=|\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{r}_2|<R/\lambda$, where $R$ is the mean value of the radii $\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\mathbf{r}_2$. Thus, as $\lambda$ increases, the effective force range decreases. For a force of range much greater than the nuclear size, only the lowest $\lambda$ (long wavelength) terms are important. At the other extreme, a $\delta$--function force has coefficients $V_\lambda(r_1,r_2)\left(=\tfrac{(2\lambda+1)}{4\pi r_1^2}\delta(r_1-r_2)\right)$ that increase with $\lambda$. In the case of $^{11}$Li(gs) one is thus confronted with the need to accept  a long range, low $\lambda$ pairing interaction, as responsible for the binding of the dineutron, halo Cooper pair to the $^9$Li core. This is equivalent to saying, an induced pairing interaction arising from the exchange of vibrations with low $\lambda$-value.
\subsection{Cooper pair binding: a novel embodiment of the Axel-Brink hypothesis.}\label{sect1F1}
In what follows we discuss a possible novel test of the Axel-Brink hypothesis\footnote{The color of an object can be determined in two ways: by illuminating it with white light and see which wavelength it absorbs, or by heating it up and see the  wavelength it emits. In both cases one is talking about dipole radiation. To describe the de-excitation process of hot nuclei requires the knowledge of the photon interactions with excited states. The common assumption, known as the Axel-Brink hypothesis, has been that each excited state of a nucleus carries a giant dipole resonance (GDR) on top of it, and that the properties of such resonances are unaffected by any excitation of the nucleus (\cite{Brink:55}, \cite{Lynn:68} pag. 321, \cite{Axel:62}; cf. also \cite{Bertsch:86}, \cite{Bortignon:98}, \cite{Martin:17} and refs. therein).}. Within the $s,p$ subspace, the most natural low multipolarity, long-wavelength vibration is the dipole mode. From systematics, the centroid of these vibrations is found at $\hbar \omega_{GDR}\approx 100$ MeV$/R$, $R$ being the nuclear radius\footnote{See \cite{Bohr:75} \cite{Bortignon:98} and \cite{Bertsch:05} and refs. therein.}. Thus, in the case of $^{11}$Li, one expects the centroid of the \textit{Giant Dipole Resonance} (GDR) carrying $\approx$100\% of the energy weighted sum rule (EWSR) at $\hbar \omega_{GDR}\approx 100$ MeV$/4.6\approx 22$ MeV. Such a high frequency mode can hardly be expected to give rise to anything, but polarization effects. On the other hand, there exists experimental evidence which testifies to the presence in $^{11}$Li, of a well defined dipole resonance with centroid at $\lessapprox1$ MeV and carrying $\approx 8$\% of the EWSR\footnote{See footnote \ref{f119C2} Ch. \ref{intro}.}. The existence of this \textit{``pygmy (dipole) resonance''} (PDR) which can be viewed as a  consequence of the existence of a low-lying particle-hole state associated with the transition $s_{1/2}\rightarrow p_{1/2}$ testifies, arguably, to the \textit{coexistence}\footnote{Within this context one can mention similar situations concerning the coexistence of spherical and quadrupole deformed states (cf. e.g. \cite{Wimmer:10}, \cite{Federman:65}, \cite{Federman:66}, \cite{Donau:67} and refs. therein; cf. also \cite{Bohr:63}), typically of nuclei with $N\approx Z$. The fact that the associated inhomogeneous damping on the GDR has modest consequences concerning dipole strength at low energies as compared with radial (isotropic) deformations in $^{11}$Li is understood in terms of the plasticity (non-Newtonian material)  of the atomic nucleus regarding quadrupole deformations (low-lying collective $2^+$ surface vibrations, fission, exotic decay (cf. \cite{Barranco:88}, \cite{Barranco:89,Bertsch:88b}, \cite{Bertsch:87})), and of the little tolerance to both compressibility and rarification displayed by the same system and connected with saturation properties (see also \cite{Broglia:19} and \cite{Broglia:19b}).} 
of two states with rather different radii in the ground state. One, closely connected with the $^{9}$Li core, ($\approx 2.5$ fm), the second with the diffuse halo ($\approx 4.6$ fm), namely displaying a large radial (isotropic) deformation (neutron skin), and thus able to induce a conspicuous inhomogeneous damping to the dipole mode. 


The importance of this mechanism is underscored by the fact that  $^{11}$Li, displaying a neutron excess $(N-Z)/A\approx0.45$ as compared to the value of 0.21 in the case of $^{208}$Pb, is able to bring down by tens of MeV a consistent fraction ($\approx 8$\%) of the TRK-sum rule. A consequence of the fact that the nucleus is most sensitive to changes in density (saturation phenomena). In the case of the halo of $^{11}$Li we are confronted with nuclear structure phenomena in a medium displaying a density of $\approx 4$\% of saturation density (Sect. \ref{App3C}, see also Eq. (\ref{eq3.2.24})). 

Before proceeding, let us estimate the overlap $\mathcal{O}$ between the two ``ground states''. Making use of a schematic expression for the single-particle radial wavefunctions\footnote{\cite{Bohr:69}.}
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{R}=\sqrt{3/R_0^3}\;\Theta(r-R_0),
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation*}
\Theta=1 \quad (r\leq R_0);\quad 0 \quad (r>R_0),
\end{equation*}
leading to,
\begin{equation}
\int_0^{\infty}dr r^2 \mathcal{R}^2(r)=\frac{3}{R_0^3}\int_0^{R_0}dr^3/3=1,
\end{equation}
one can work out the overlap $\mathcal{O}$ between the two halo neutrons and the core nucleons. That is, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq2.6.4}
\begin{split}
\mathcal{O}&=|\langle\mathcal{R}_{halo}|\mathcal{R}_{core}\rangle|^2=\left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{R_0^3}}\sqrt{\frac{3}{R^3}}\int_0^{\infty}dr\,r^2\Theta(r-R)\Theta(r-R_0)\right)^2\\
&=\left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{R_0^3}}\sqrt{\frac{3}{R^3}}\int_0^{R_0}dr^3/3\,\right)^2=(R_0/R)^3=0.20,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where use has been made of $\Theta(r-R)\Theta(r-R_0)=\Theta(r-R_0), R_0=1.2A^{1/3} \text{ fm}=2.7 \text{ fm} (A=11)$ and $R=(4.58\pm 0.013)$ fm.
Because of the small value of this overlap, one can posit that the $E_x\lesssim1$ MeV ($\Gamma \approx 0.5$ MeV) soft $E1$-mode of $^{11}$Li is a \textit{bona fide} dipole  resonance based on an exotic, unusually extended $\ket{0_\nu}$ state of radial dimensions equivalent, according to systematics, to  a system of effective $A$ mass number about 5 times that of the actual system $(A\approx (4.6/1.2)^3\approx 60)$ .
 Thus consistent with the connotation of PDR.

\textit{It is of notice that the small values of $r$ and of $\mathcal{O}$ have essentially the same origin}. On the other hand, they have apparently, rather different physical consequences. In fact, the first makes the bare pairing interaction strength $G$ subcritical, while the second one screens the repulsive symmetry potential $V_1(\approx +25 $ MeV)\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Bortignon:98} Eq. (3.48) and refs. therein.}, that is, the energy price one has to pay to separate protons from neutrons. This effect allows for a consistent fraction of the dipole Thomas--Reiche--Kuhn sum rule, that is of the $J^{\pi}=1^-$ energy weighted sum rule (EWSR), to come low in energy ($p_{1/2}-s_{1/2}$ transition) from the value $E_{GDR}\approx(100/R)$ MeV and, acting as an intermediate boson between the two halo neutrons, glue them to the $^{9}$Li core. \textit{Summing up, the halo anti-pairing effect $G_{scr}=r\times G\ll G<G_{crit}$ triggers ($\mathcal{O}V_1\ll V_1$) the virtual presence of a ``gas'' of dipole (pygmy) bosons which, exchanged between the two halo neutrons (cf. Fig. \ref{pigmy}), overcompensates the reduction of the bare pairing interaction, leading to the binding of the halo Cooper pair to the core (anti-(halo anti-pairing effect)). It can thus be stated that the halo of $^{11}$Li and the pygmy dipole resonance\footnote{In which the two halo neutrons oscillate out of phase with respect to nucleons of the core $^9$Li moving in phase (see \cite{Broglia:19}).} built on top of it constitute a pair of symbiotic states (see also Chapter \ref{C8}).}

Let us further elaborate on these issues. Making use of the relation $\langle r^2\rangle^{1/2}\approx (3/5)^{1/2}R$ between mean square radius and the radius, one may write
\begin{equation}\label{eq2.6.9}
\langle r^2\rangle_{^{11}\text{Li}}\approx \frac{3}{5}R_{eff}^2(^{11}\text{Li}).
\end{equation}
 with
\begin{equation}\label{eq2.6.10}
R_{eff}^2(^{11}\text{Li})=\left(\frac{9}{11}R_0^2(^9\text{Li})+\frac{2}{11}\left(\frac{\xi}{2}\right)^2\right),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
R_0(^9\text{Li})=2.5 \text{fm},
\end{equation}
is the $^9$Li radius ($R_0=r_0A^{1/3}, r_0=1.2$fm), while $\xi$ is the correlation length of the Cooper pair neutron halo. An estimate of this quantity is provided by the relation
 \begin{equation}
\xi=\frac{\hbar v_F}{\pi E_{corr}}\approx 20 \, \text{fm},
 \end{equation}
in keeping with the fact that in $^{11}$Li, $(v_F/c)\approx 0.16$ and $E_{corr}\approx-0.5$ MeV (see App. \ref{App6H}). Consequently, 
\begin{align}\label{eq2.F.5}
R_{eff}\,(^{11}\text{Li})\approx 4.8 \;\text{fm},
\end{align} 
and  $\langle r^2\rangle_{^{11}\text{Li}}^{1/2}\approx 3.7$ fm, to be compared with the experimental value\footnote{\cite{Kobayashi:89}.} $\langle r^2\rangle_{^{11}\text{Li}}^{1/2}= 3.55\pm0.1$fm. It is of notice that this experimental value implies  the radius $R$($^{11}$Li)$=\sqrt{5/3\langle r^2\rangle_{^{11}\text{Li}}}=4.58\pm 0.13$ fm.


We now proceed to the calculation of the centroid of the dipole pygmy resonance of $^{11}$Li in  RPA making use of the separable interaction
 \begin{equation}\label{eq2.F.6}
H_D=-\kappa_1\vec D\cdot\vec D
 \end{equation}
where $\vec D=\vec r$ and
 \begin{equation}
\kappa_1=\frac{-5V_1}{AR^2}.
 \end{equation}
  $V_1=25$ MeV being the symmetry potential energy.
The  RPA dispersion relation is\footnote{See (3.30) p.55 of \cite{Bortignon:98}.}
\begin{equation}\label{eq3.6.16}
W(E)=\sum_{k,i}\frac{2(\epsilon_k-\epsilon_i)|\langle \tilde i|F|k\rangle|^2}{(\epsilon_k-\epsilon_i)^2-E^2}=\frac{1}{\kappa_1}.
\end{equation}
 Making use of this relation as well as (see Fig. \ref{fig1.9.1}) 
 $\epsilon_{\nu_k}-\epsilon_{\nu_i}=\tilde\epsilon_{p_{1/2}}-\tilde\epsilon_{s_{1/2}}\approx 0.45 $MeV, and that the EWSR associated with the $^{11}$Li pygmy resonance is $\approx 8$\% of the total Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule\footnote{The Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule (\cite{Bohr:75,Bortignon:98}) TRK=$\frac{9}{4\pi} \frac{\hbar^2e^2}{2m} \frac{NZ}{A}=14.8 \frac{NZ}{A} e^2\text{ fm}^2 \text{ MeV}$ has a value of 32.3 $e^2$ MeV fm$^2$ for $^{11}_3$Li$_8$. Assuming a systematic behaviour, the centroid of the giant dipole resonance is expected at $\hbar\omega_D\approx80/A^{1/3}$ MeV $\approx 36$ MeV, leading to the ratio 32.3 $e^2$ MeV fm$^2/(36\text{ MeV})\approx 0.9 e^2$ fm$^2$. The $E1$--single--particle (Weisskopf) unit can be written as (\cite{Bohr:69} p. 389, Eq. (3C-38)) $B_W(E1)\approx ((1.2)^2/4\pi) (3/4)^2 A^{2/3} (e_{E1})^2$ fm$^2=0.32 (e_{E1})^2$ fm$^2$, $e_{E1}$ being the effective dipole charge equal to $(N/A)e=0.73 e$ for the protons of $^{11}$Li, and $-(Z/A)e=0.27$ for the neutrons. Making use of the average value one can write $\bar B_W(E1)\approx0.1 e^2$ fm$^2$. Thus 8\%TRK/$\bar B_W(E1)\approx 0.072/0.1\approx 0.7$. In other words, about 1 single--particle unit is associated with the eventual $\gamma$--decay of the PDR of $^{11}$Li.}
 \begin{equation}
\sum_n |\langle0|F|n\rangle|^2(E_n-E_0)=\frac{\hbar^2}{2M}\int d\mathbf r |\vec\nabla F|^2 \rho(r),
 \end{equation}
 which, for $F=r$ has the value\footnote{cf. \cite{Bertsch:05} pag. 53.} $\hbar^2 A/2M$ one can write the numerator of Eq. (\ref{eq3.6.16}) as, 
\begin{equation}
2\times 0.08\times \frac{\hbar^2A}{2M}=\frac{1}{\kappa_1}[(0.45\text{MeV})^2-(\hbar \omega_{pygmy})^2],
\end{equation}
 and thus
\begin{equation}
 (\hbar\omega_{pygmy})^2=(0.45 \text{MeV})^2-2\times 0.08\times\frac{\hbar^2A}{2M}\kappa_1,
\end{equation}
 where\footnote{see \cite{Bortignon:98}.}
\begin{equation}\label{eq2.6.14}
\kappa_1=-\frac{5V_1}{A(\xi/2)^2}\left(\frac{2}{11}\right)=-\frac{125\text{MeV}}{A 100 \text{ fm}^2}\left(\frac{2}{11}\right)\approx -0.021\text{ fm}^{-2}\text{ MeV},
\end{equation}
the ratio in parenthesis reflecting the fact that only 2 out of 11 nucleons, slosh back and forth in an extended configuration with little overlap with the other nucleons. The quantity,
\begin{equation}\label{eq2.6.21}
\kappa_1^0=-\frac{5V_1}{AR^2_{eff}(^{11}\text{Li})}\approx 0.49\; \text{MeV fm}^{-2},
\end{equation}
is the ``standard'' self consistent dipole strength\footnote{cf. \cite{Bohr:75}.}. The screening factor $s=(\kappa_1/\kappa_1^0)=(R^2_{eff}\times(2/11))/(\xi/2)^2=0.043$ is very close in magnitude to the ratio $r(=0.048$, Eq. (\ref{eq2.6.3})) and has a similar physical origin. It is of notice that $(V_1)_{scr}=sV_1\approx 1$ MeV. Making use of (\ref{eq2.6.14})  one obtains,
\begin{equation}
-2\times 0.08\frac{\hbar^2A}{2M}\kappa_1\approx 0.74 \text{MeV}^2\approx (0.86\text{MeV})^2.
\end{equation}

    nuclear diffusivity. (bottom) Phase shift  parameter associated with the elastic scattering of two nucleons moving in states of time reversal, so
    called $^1S_0$ phase shift, in keeping with the fact that the system is in a singlet state of spin zero. Positive values of $\delta$ implies an attractive interaction, negative a repulsive one. For low relative velocities
    (kinetic energies $E_L$), i.e. for a situation similar to that found for nucleons moving around the nuclear surface where the density is low, the $^1S_0$ phase shift arizing from the exchange of mesons (e.g. pions, represented by an horizontal dotted  line) between nucleons (represented by upward pointing arrowed lines)
    is attractive. This mechanism provides about half of the glue to nucleons moving in time reversal states to form Cooper pairs. Cooper pair formation is
    further assisted by the exchange of collective surface vibrations (wavy curve in the scattering process) between the members of the
    pair.}\label{fig1F1}

  \end{figure}

 Let us now estimate the binding energy which the exchange of the pygmy resonance between the two neutrons of the halo Cooper pair  of $^{11}$Li can provide.
The associated particle--vibration coupling\footnote{cf. e.g. \cite{Brink:05} Eq. (8.42) p.189.} is $\Lambda= \left(\partial W(E)/\partial E|_{\hbar\omega_{pygmy}}\right)^{-1/2}$. Note the use in what follows of a dimensionless dipole single--particle field $F'=F/R_{eff}(^{11}\text{Li})$). This is in keeping with the fact that one wants to obtain a quantity with energy dimensions ($[\Lambda]=$ MeV), and that $\kappa_1$ has been introduced through the Hamiltonian $H_D$ with the self consistent value normalized in terms of $R_{eff}^2(^{11}$Li) (Eq. (\ref{eq2.6.21})). 
 One then obtains
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Lambda&=\left\{2\hbar \omega_{pygmy}\frac{2\times 0.08(\frac{\hbar^2A}{2M})/R_{eff}^2}{\left[(\tilde\epsilon_{p_{1/2}}-\tilde\epsilon_{s_{1/2}})^2-(\hbar\omega_{pygmy})^2\right]^2}\right\}^{-1/2},\\
&=\left\{2\text{MeV}\frac{0.16(\hbar^2A/2M)(1/4.8)^2\,\text{fm}^2}{\left[(0.45\text{ MeV})^2-(1\text{MeV})^2\right]^2}\right\}^{-1/2},\\
&=\left(\frac{3\,\text{MeV}^2}{(0.8)^2\,\text{MeV}^4}\right)^{-1/2}\approx 0.5\,\text{MeV},
\end{split}
\end{equation}   
The value of the induced interaction matrix elements is then given by (Fig. \ref{pigmy}),
 \begin{equation}\label{eq2.F.10}
M_{ind}=\frac{2\Lambda^2}{DEN}\approx-\frac{2\Lambda^2}{\hbar\omega_{pygmy}}\approx-0.5\,\text{MeV},
 \end{equation}
 the factor of two arising from the two time ordering contributions. The resulting correlation energy is thus $E_{corr}=2\tilde\epsilon_{s_{1/2}}-G_{scr}+M_{ind}=(0.3-0.1-0.5)\text{ MeV}\approx- 0.3$ MeV, in overall agreement with the experimental\footnote{\cite{Bachelet:08}, \cite{Smith:08}.} findings ($-0.380$ MeV). It is of notice that in this estimate the (subcritical) effect of the screened bare pairing interaction has also been used (see Eq. (\ref{eq1C2AppF}))\footnote{That new physics, namely a novel mechanism to (dynamically) violate gauge invariance finds, to express itself, a scenario of a barely bound Cooper pair at the drip line (half life 8.75 ms), seems to confirm a recurrent expectation. That truly new complex phenomena appear at the border between rigid order and randomness (see \cite{DeGennes:94}).}, as well as  the theoretical value\footnote{See footnotes \ref{f5.28} and \ref{f5.29} of Ch. \ref{C6}.} $\tilde\epsilon_{1/2}=0.15$ MeV (Fig. \ref{fig1.9.1}).
 
 
 
 This schematic model\footnote{See also \cite{Broglia:19b}.} has been implemented with microscopic detail\footnote{cf. \cite{Barranco:01}; see also \cite{Potel:10}.} within the framework of a field theoretical description of the interweaving of collective vibrations and single--particle motion, and is also discussed  within the context of single-particle (Chapter \ref{C6}) and two-particle (Chapter \ref{C8}) transfer processes. Here we provide a summary of the theoretical findings. 
 
 
 
 
 In Fig. \ref{fig1F3} \textbf{(I)}, the lowest single-particle neutron virtual and resonant states of  $^{10}$Li are indicated\footnote{\cite{Barranco:01}. For a more detailed (NFT) study of $^{10}$Li see \cite{Barranco:20} (see also Sect. \ref{S5.2.4}). See also \cite{Moro:19}.}. The 
  position of the levels $s_{1/2}$ and $p_{1/2}$ determined making use
 of mean-field theory is shown (left hatched area and thin horizontal
 line, respectively). The coupling of a single--neutron (upward
 pointing arrowed line) to a vibration (wavy line) calculated
 making use of NFT Feynman diagrams 
 (schematically depicted also in terms of either solid dots (neutron)
 or open circles (neutron hole) moving in a single-particle
 level around or in the $^9$Li core (grey circle)), leads to conspicuous
 shifts in the energy centroid of the $s_{1/2}$ and $p_{1/2}$ resonances
 (shown by thick horizontal lines to the right) and eventually to
 an inversion in their sequence. In Fig. \ref{fig1F3} \textbf{(II)} the  processes contributing to  binding the  halo neutron system $^{11}$Li are displayed. One starts with the dressed mean  field
 picture in which two neutrons (solid dots) coupled to angular momentum and parity $0^+$ move in
 time-reversal states around the core $^{9}$Li (hatched area) in the
 $s_{1/2}$ virtual state leading to an unbound $s^2
 _{1/2}(0)$ configuration.  The associated spatial structure of the uncorrelated pair is shown in \textbf{a)}. The exchange
 of vibrations between the two neutrons displayed in the upper
 part of the figure leads to an induced pairing interaction
 which, added to the bare nucleon-nucleon Argonne potential\footnote{\cite{Wiringa:84}.}  (see boxed inset) which, as can be seen from the figure, is subcritical, correlates the
 two-neutron system leading to a bound state $|\tilde 0\rangle$. The corresponding   wavefunction is  displayed in \textbf{b)}, together with the spatial structure of the resulting Cooper pair. It is of notice that a large fraction of the induced interaction arises from the exchange of the pygmy dipole resonance between the two halo neutrons.  Within this scenario one can posit that the $^{11}$Li PDR  can hardly be viewed but in symbiosis with the $^{9}$Li halo neutron pair addition mode and vice versa. Furthermore, that the two halo neutrons of $^{11}$Li, provide the first example of a Van der Waals Cooper pair, the first of its type in nuclei (Sect.. \ref{C2SG2} and Fig. \ref{fig2.A.1}). For further details see Chapter \ref{C8} as well as\footnote{\cite{Barranco:01}.}.
 
 
 

 \section{Nuclear van der Waals Cooper pair}\label{C2SG2}
 The atomic van der Waals (dispersive, retarded) interaction which, like gravitation,  acts between all atoms and molecules, also non-polar, can be written for two systems placed at a distance $R$ as (see App. \ref{C2AppD}), 
 \begin{align}\label{eq1C2AppG}
 \Delta E=-\frac{6\times e^2 \times a_0^5}{R^6}=-\frac{16}{(R/a_0)^6}\left(\frac{e^2}{2a_0}\times 0.75\right),
 \end{align}
 where $a_0$ is the Bohr radius. One recognizes in the term in parenthesis the transition energy $2P\to1S$ of the hydrogen atom. A possible qualitative nuclear parallel (see Fig. \ref{fig2.A.1})  can be established making the  correspondences  of the term in parenthesis with $\tilde\epsilon_{p_{1/2}}-\tilde\epsilon_{s_{1/2}}\approx0.45$ MeV, $R$ with $R_{eff}\approx4.6$ fm and $a_0$ with $R_0(^{11}\text{Li})\approx3$ fm, leading to $\Delta E\approx-0.6$ MeV (=$M_{ind}$).
  Thus,
 \begin{align*}
E_{corr}=2\tilde{\epsilon}_{s_{1/2}}-G_{scr}+\Delta E=0.3\,\text{MeV}-0.1\,\text{MeV}-0.6\,\text{MeV}\approx -0.4\text{ MeV}.
 \end{align*} 


   \begin{figure}
   \centerline{\includegraphics*[width=17cm,angle=0]{nutshell/figs/VdW.pdf}}\caption{NFT Feynman diagrams describing the binding of the halo Cooper pair through pygmy. That is, producing the symbiotic mode involving the pair addition mode and the PDR. The single-particle states $s_{1/2}$ and $p_{1/2}$ are labeled in \textbf{(a)} $s$ and $p$ for simplicity. The different particle-vibration coupling vertices (either with the quadrupole ($2^+$) or with the pygmy ($1^-$) modes drawn as  wavy lines) are denoted by a solid dot, and numbered in increasing time sequence so as to show that diagram \textbf{(b)} emerges from \textbf{(a)} through time ordering. The motion of the neutrons are drawn in terms of continuous solid curves. In keeping with the fact that the occupation of the single-particle states is neither 1 nor 0 we treat, for simplicity, these states  as quasiparticle states. Thus no arrow is drawn on them. Diagram (\textbf{a}) emphasizes the self-energy renormalization of the state $s_{1/2}$ lying in the continuum and which   through its clothing with the quadrupole mode is brought down becoming a virtual ($\widetilde\epsilon_{s_{1/2}}\approx0.2$ MeV) state (see (I) and (II)), while (III) contributes to the induced pairing interaction through pygmy (see also Fig. \ref{pigmy}). The ``eagle'' diagram (\textbf{b}) contains ((IV) and (V)) Pauli corrections which push the bound state $p_{1/2}$ into a resonant state in the continuum ($\widetilde\epsilon_{p_{1/2}}\approx0.5$ MeV). In other words, processes (I), (II), (III), (IV) and (V) are at the basis of parity inversion, and of the appearance of the new magic number $N=6$. Processes (VI) and (VII) are associated with the pygmy ZPF, while (VIII) contributes to the induced pairing interaction through pygmy (van der Waals-like process).}\label{fig2.A.1}

 \section{Renormalized coupling constants $^{11}$Li: resum\'e}\label{C2SF2}
The fact that the screening factors   $r$ and $s$ (see Eqs. (\ref{eq2.6.3}),  (\ref{eq3.6.2}); also (\ref{eq2.6.21}) and subsequent paragraph), essentially coincide within numerical approximations is in keeping with the fact that both quantities are closely related to the overlap\footnote{One can equivalently use $\left(R_0/R_{eff}\right)^3\approx\left( 2.7\text{ fm}/(4.8\text{ fm})\right)^3\approx0.18$.}
  \begin{align}
\mathcal{O}=\left(\frac{R_0}{R}\right)^3=\left(\frac{2.7\,\text{fm}}{4.6\,\text{fm}}\right)^3=0.2,
  \end{align}
quantity which has two main effects concerning the mechanism which is at the basis of much of the nuclear structure of the halo exotic nucleus $^{11}$Li : \textbf{1)} it makes subcritical the screened bare $NN$-pairing interaction $G_{scr}=r\times G<G_c$ ($G_{scr}=1\,\text{MeV}/A$); \textbf{2)} it screens the symmetry potential drastically, reducing the energy price one has to pay to separate protons from delocalized neutrons, permitting a consistent chunk ($\approx 8$\%) of the TRK sum rule\footnote{See footnote \ref{f119C2} Ch. \ref{intro}.} to  become essentially degenerate with the  ground state ($(V_1)_{scr}=1 \,\text{MeV}$). In other words,  allowing for, allegedly, the first nuclear example of a van der Waals Cooper pair and a novel mechanism to break dynamically gauge invariance. Namely, dipole--dipole fluctuating fields associated with the exchange of the pygmy dipole resonance between the halo neutrons of $^{11}$Li. As a result, a new, (composite) elementary mode of nuclear excitation joins the ranks of the previously known: the halo pair addition mode carrying on top of it, a low--lying collective pygmy resonance. This symbiotic mode can be studied through two-particle transfer reactions, eventually in coincidence with $\gamma$--decay. In particular, making use of the reaction $^{9}$Li$(t,p)^{11}$Li$(f)$ for

as well as pygmy $(L=1)$ on top of it, arguably the $1^-$ state at $E_x=2.70$ MeV being part of this mode\footnote{\cite{Iwasaki:00}.}.
  \begin{subappendices}
\section[Lindemann criterion and  quantality parameter]{Lindemann criterion and connection with quantality parameter}\label{C2AppC}
The original Lindemann criterion\footnote{\cite{Lindemann:10}.} compares the atomic fluctuation amplitude $\langle\Delta r^2\rangle^{1/2}$ with the lattice constant $a$ of a crystal. If this ratio, which is defined as the disorder parameter $\Delta_L$, reaches a certain value, fluctuations cannot increase without damaging or destroying the crystal lattice. The results of experiments and simulations show that the critical value of $\Delta_L$ for simple solids is in the range of 0.10 to 0.15, relatively independent of the type of substance, the nature of the interaction potential, and the crystal structure\footnote{\cite{Bilgram:87,Lowen:94,Stillinger:95}.}. Applications of this criterion to an inhomogeneous finite system like a protein in its native state (aperiodic crystal)\footnote{\cite{Schrodinger:44}.}, requires evaluation of the generalized Lindemann parameter\footnote{\cite{Stillinger:90}.}
\begin{align}
\Delta_L=\frac{\sqrt{\sum_i\langle \Delta r_i^2\rangle/N}}{a'},
\end{align}  
where $N$ is the number of atoms and $a'$ the most probable non-bonded near-neighbor distance, $\mathbf r_i$ being the position of atom $i$, $\Delta r_i^2=(\mathbf r_i-\langle \mathbf r_i\rangle)^2$, and $\langle\rangle$ denotes configurational averages at the conditions of measurement or simulations (e.g. biological, in which case $T\approx 310$ K, PH$\approx 7$, etc.\footnote{Fluctuations, classical (thermal) or quantal imply a probabilistic description. While one can only predict the odds for a given outcome of an experiment in quantum mechanics, probabilities themselves evolve in a deterministic fashion  (\cite{Born:48}).}). The dynamics as a function of the distance from the geometric center of the protein is characterized by defining an interior ($int$) Lindemann parameter, 
\begin{align}
\Delta^{int}_L(r_{cut})=\frac{\sqrt{\sum_{i,r_i<r_{cut}}\langle \Delta r_i^2\rangle/N}}{a'},
\end{align}  
which is obtained by averaging over the atoms that are within a chosen cutoff distance, $r_{cut}$, from the center of mass of the protein.

Simulations and experimental data for a number of proteins, in particular Barnase, Myoglobin, Crambin and Ribonuclease A indicate 0.14 as the critical value distinguishing between solid--like and liquid--like behaviour, and $r_{cut}\approx 6$ \AA. As can be seen from Table \ref{tab2C1}, the interior of a protein, under physiological conditions, is solid--like  ($\Delta_L<0.14$), while its surface is liquid--like ($\Delta_L>0.14$). The beginning of thermal denaturation in the simulations appears to be related to the melting of its interior (i.e. $\Delta^{int}_L>0.14$), so that the entire protein becomes liquid--like. This is also the situation of the denatured state of a protein under physiological conditions\footnote{see e.g. \cite{Rosner:17}.}

\subsection{Lindemann (``disorder'') parameter for a nucleus}
An estimate of  $\sqrt{\sum_i\langle \Delta r_i^2\rangle/A}$ in the case of nuclei considered as a sphere of nuclear matter of radius $R_0$, is provided by the ``spill out'' of nucleons due to quantal effects. That is\footnote{\cite{Bertsch:05}, see e.g. Ch. 5. See also paragraph following Eq. (\ref{eq3App3E}).} $\sqrt{\vphantom{\Sigma}\quad}\approx 0.69\times a_0$, where $a_0$ is of the order of the nuclear diffusivity  ($\approx 0.65$ fm).
The average internucleon distance can be estimated to be $2\times r_0\approx 2.4$ fm. Thus,
\begin{align}
\Delta_L=\frac{0.69 a_0}{2.4\;\text{fm}}\approx0.19.
\end{align} 
While it is difficult to compare among them crystals, aperiodic finite crystals and atomic nuclei, arguably, the above value indicates that a nucleus is liquid-like. 
\section{The van der Waals interaction}\label{C2AppD}
% \begin{figure}
%  \centerline{\includegraphics*[width=15cm,angle=0]{nutshell/figs/fig2D1.pdf}}
%  \caption{}\label{fig2.D.1}
%  \end{figure}
Historically one can distinguish two contributions to the van der Waals interaction\footnote{Let us mainly think of non polar (NP) molecules.}: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{dispersive} retarded contribution\footnote{dispersion: variation of a quantity, e.g. spatial separation of white light (rainbow), as a function of frequency (c.f. e.g. \cite{Israelachvili:85}, p.65).}, emerging from the dynamical dipole-dipole, as well as from higher multipolarities, interaction associated with the quantum mechanical zero point fluctuations (ZPF) of the ground state of the two interacting atoms or molecules\footnote{These forces act between all atoms and molecules, even non-polar, totally neutral ones.}.
\item \textbf{inductive} implying the polarization of one molecule in the permanent dipole or quadrupole field of the other molecule\footnote{\cite{Debye:20,Debye:21}.} 
\end{enumerate}

%  \begin{figure}
%   \centerline{\includegraphics*[width=15cm,angle=0]{nutshell/figs/fig2D2.pdf}}
%   \caption{Schematic representation concerning the response to photons of both nuclei and metal clusters (after \cite{Broglia:92}).}\label{fig2.D.2}
%   \end{figure}
It is only the first one which is a \textit{bona fide} van der Waals interaction. In fact with the advent of quantum mechanics it was very early  recognized\footnote{\cite{London:30}.} that for most molecules, interactions of type 2 are small compared with interactions of type 1. That is the interaction corresponding to the mutual polarization of one molecule in the rapidly changing field --due to the instantaneous configuration of electrons and nuclei-- of the other molecule\footnote{\cite{Pauling:63} p. 384, \cite{Born:69} p. 471.}.



%In connection with theories of systems with many degrees of freedom (i.e. fields-- and (many--body)--systems) developed in particular by Anderson, Nambu and Goldstone, it has been recognized that the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking is at the basis of physical emergent properties (see App. \ref{C2AppE}).
%
%
%Within the present context, an atom violates translational invariance as its center of mass (CM) occupies a definite position in space defining a privileged origin for a reference frame. Setting both ions and electrons in uniform motion through a Galilean transformation restores symmetry, the inertia being the total mass (App. \ref{App1.D}). Thus, when one pushes the system  on one end it starts moving as a rigid body (generalized rigidity), without the need  of propagation of information through it.
%
%
%Such a motion (isoscalar in the case of the atomic nuclei, where $N$ and $Z$ move in phase, equivalent to electrons and ions doing so in the case of condensed or soft matter) display zero restoring force. Thus, the associated ZPF diverge requiring, quantum mechanically, a state orthogonal to it in which the two types of constituents particles (electrons and ions, neutrons and protons), move out of phase. Such a state is, in the nuclear case\footnote{Note however the  pygmy halo resonance, soft $E1$--mode in the neutron halo nuclei like $^{11}$Li, which essentially forces a permanent dipole in the $\ket{^{11}\text{Li (gs)}}$.} the GDR and corresponds to a mode in which protons and neutrons slosh back and forth out of phase (isovector mode), a situation which is similar to that of atomic clusters (Mie resonance). In the atomic or molecular case these states (dipole vibration of electrons against the positive ions) are rather directly related to the single--electron atomic shell physics ($1s\to2p$ transition in the case of the H atom). Two atoms displaying the above ZPF will interact through van der Waals (dispersive, retarded) interaction.
\subsection{van der Waals interaction between two hydrogen atoms}
For large values of the internuclear distance $r_{AB}=R$, the exchange phenomenon is unimportant (Pauli principle) and one can take as the unperturbed wavefunction for a system of two hydrogen atoms  the simple product of two hydrogenlike wavefunctions,
\begin{align}\label{eq2.D.1}
\Psi^0=u_{1sA}(1)u_{1sB}(2).
\end{align}
%   \begin{figure}
%    \centerline{\includegraphics*[width=5cm,angle=0]{nutshell/figs/fig3D1_v2.pdf}}
%    \caption{Schematic representation of the lowest single--particle levels in which the electron can move in a hydrogen atom.}\label{fig2.D.3}
%    \end{figure}
The perturbation for this wavefunction arises from the potential energy terms
\begin{align}\label{eq2.D.2}
H'=\frac{e^2}{r_{12}}+\frac{e^2}{r_{AB}}-\frac{e^2}{r_{A2}}-\frac{e^2}{r_{B1}},
\end{align}
corresponding to the variety of Coulomb interactions involving electrons and protons. Let us assume for simplicity that we are dealing with a one-dimensional problem, in which case one can write (Fig. \ref{fig2.D.4})
\begin{align}\label{eq2.D.3}
\nonumber \mathbf r_{12}&=\left(R+z_1+z_2\right)\hat {\mathbf{z}},\\
\nonumber \mathbf r_{AB}&=R\,\hat {\mathbf{z}},\\
\nonumber \mathbf r_{A2}&=\left(R+z_2\right)\hat {\mathbf{z}},\\
\mathbf r_{B1}&=\left(R+z_1\right)\hat {\mathbf{z}}.
\end{align}

    \begin{figure}
     \centerline{\includegraphics*[width=5cm,angle=0]{nutshell/figs/fig2D4_v2.pdf}}
     \caption{Planar configuration assumed for two hydrogen atoms at a relative distance $R$, where $p$ stands for proton and $e$ for electron.}\label{fig2.D.4}
     \end{figure}
Because all these distances are much larger than the radius of the atom ($a_0\approx0.529$ \AA, Bohr radius) the expression (\ref{eq2.D.2}) can be calculated making use of a Taylor expansion. One obtains
\begin{align}\label{eq2.D.4}
r_{12}^2=(R+z_1+z_2)^2=R^2\left[1+2\frac{(z_1+z_2)}{R}+\frac{(z_1+z_2)^2}{R^2}\right],
\end{align}
which leads to 
\begin{align}\label{eq2.D.5}
\frac{e^2}{r_{12}}=\frac{e^2}{R\left[1+\frac{2(z_1+z_2)}{R}+\frac{(z_1+z_2)^2}{R^2}\right]^{1/2}}\approx\frac{e^2}{R}\left[1-\frac{(z_1+z_2)}{R}-\frac{(z_1+z_2)^2}{2R^2}\right].
\end{align}
 Similarly
\begin{align}\label{eq2.D.6}
r^2_{A2}=\left(R^2+2Rz_2+z_2^2\right)=R^2\left(1+2\frac{z_2}{R}+\frac{z_2^2}{R^2}\right),
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}\label{eq2.D.7}
r^2_{B1}=R^2\left(1+2\frac{z_1}{R}+\frac{z_1^2}{R^2}\right),
\end{align}
leading to
\begin{align}\label{eq2.D.8}
-\frac{e^2}{r_{A2}}=-\frac{e^2}{R}\left(1-\frac{z_2}{R}-\frac{z_2^2}{2R^2}\right),
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}\label{eq2.D.9}
-\frac{e^2}{r_{B1}}=-\frac{e^2}{R}\left(1-\frac{z_1}{R}-\frac{z_1^2}{2R^2}\right).
\end{align}
Finally
\begin{align}\label{eq2.D.10}
\frac{e^2}{r_{AB}}=\frac{e^2}{R}.
\end{align}
With the exception of the cross term of (\ref{eq2.D.5}) there is complete cancellation between the different contributions to (\ref{eq2.D.2}). Thus
\begin{align}\label{eq2.D.11}
H'=-\frac{\mathbf D_1\cdot\mathbf D_2}{R^3},
\end{align} 
where
\begin{align}\label{eq2.D.12}
\mathbf D_i=ez_i\,\hat {\mathbf{z}}
\end{align} 
is the dipole moment operator associated with electron $i$. Because $R\gg z_i$, one can diagonalize the interaction Hamiltonian (\ref{eq2.D.11}) perturbatively. In keeping with the fact that   a single--particle quantum state displaying a given parity (and in the present case angular momentum $(-1)^\ell=\pi$) cannot sustain a permanent dipole moment, in particular
\begin{align}\label{eq2.D.13}
\int d\tau u_{1s}(z)\times z\times u_{1s}(z)=\int d\tau (u_{1s}(z))^2z=\int d\tau \rho(z)z=0,
\end{align} 
 the lowest perturbative correction to (\ref{eq2.D.1}) is of second order. This is in keeping with the fact that we are dealing with interaction through virtual processes. The associated energy correction is given by the relation,
 \begin{align}\label{eq2.D.14}
\Delta E_z^{(2)}=-\sum_{int}\frac{\braket{0|H'|int}\braket{int|H'|0}}{E_{int}-E_0}.
 \end{align} 
 Because we are concerned with the $1s\to 2p$ transition (Fig. \ref{fig2.D.5}), the intermediate state is
  \begin{align}\label{eq2.D.15}
\Psi^{int}=u_{2pA}(1)u_{2pB}(2),
  \end{align} 
 and thus
  \begin{align}\label{eq2.D.16}
D_{en}=E_{int}-E_0.
   \end{align} 
   
        \begin{figure}[h]
         \centerline{\includegraphics*[width=4cm,angle=0]{nutshell/figs/fig2D5_v2.pdf}}
         \caption{Schematic representation of the virtual process associated with (\ref{eq2.D.14}), the intermediate, virtual state being the $2p$ state.}\label{fig2.D.5}
         \end{figure}
  One can then write
  \begin{align}\label{eq2.D.17}
  \nonumber \Delta E_z^{(2)}=&-\frac{|\braket{0|H'|0}|^2}{D_{en}}=-\frac{e^4}{R^6}\frac{|\braket{0|z_1^2z_2^2|0}|^2}{D_{en}},\\
\nonumber  &\approx-\frac{e^4}{R^6}\frac{\int d\tau_1\,d\tau_2u^2_{1s}(1)u^2_{1s}(2)z_1^2z_2^2}{D_{en}},\\
\nonumber  &=-\frac{e^4}{R^6}\frac{\int d\tau_1\rho(z_1)z_1^2\,\int d\tau_2\rho(z_2)z_2^2}{D_{en}},\\
&=-\frac{e^4}{R^6}\frac{\bar z_1^2 \bar z_2^2}{D_{en}}\approx-\frac{e^4}{R^6}\frac{a_0^2a_0^2}{\frac{e^2}{2a_0}}=-\frac{2e^2a_0^5}{R^6}.  
   \end{align} 
This result corresponds to the $z$--degree of freedom of the system (two H atoms at a distance $R\gg a_0$). One has then to multiply the above result by 3 to take into account the $x$ and $y$ degrees of freedom. Thus   
   \begin{align}\label{eq2.D.18}
\Delta E^{(2)}=-\frac{6e^2a_0^5}{R^6}.
 \end{align}
Let us now calculate the van der Waals interaction between two H--atoms at a distance of the order of ten times the summed radii of the two atoms ($\approx2a_0\approx1$\AA), that is for $R\approx10$\AA, 
  \begin{align}\label{eq2.D.19}
  \nonumber \Delta E_{H-H}^{(2)}(10\text{ \AA})\approx&-\frac{6\times14.4\text{ eV \AA}(0.529\text{ \AA})^5}{(10\text{ \AA})^6}\\
  &\approx-3.6\times10^{-6}\text{ eV}=-3.6\,\mu\text{eV}  
   \end{align}  
Making use of the relation
\begin{align}\label{eq2.D.20}
1\text{ eV}=2.42\times 10^{14}\text{ Hz},\quad(1\text{Hz=s}^{-1})  
   \end{align}  
 one obtains
\begin{align}\label{eq2.D.21}
|\Delta E_{H-H}^{(2)}(10\text{ \AA})|\approx3.6\times 10^{-6}\times 2.42\times 10^{14}\text{ Hz}\approx9\times10^8\text{ Hz}\approx10^3\text{ MHz},      
\end{align} 
 a quantity which can be compared with the Lamb shift (1058 MHz; see Fig. \ref{fig6.2.1x}). It is of notice that $|\Delta E_{H-H}^{(2)}(2.5\text{ \AA})|\approx15\text{ meV}/$part$\approx0.35$ kcal/mole, (1meV/part$\approx0.02306$ kcal/mole), a value of the order of $kT/2$. That is, one half of the thermal energy under biological conditions ($T\approx$ 300 K, $kT\approx 0.6$ kcal/mole)\footnote{\cite{Huang:05}.}, in keeping with the role played by the Van der Waals interaction in the folding and stability of proteins.
% \subsection{Critical dimension for van der Waals H-H interaction (protein folding domain)}
% Let us calculate the frequency associated with the $1s\to 2p$ transition ($\approx$1 Ry=13.6 eV),
% \begin{align}\label{eq2.D.22}
%\hbar\omega_e=13.6\text{ eV}.    
% \end{align} 
% Making use of
% \begin{align}\label{eq2.D.23}
% \hbar c=2000\text{ eV \AA},
% \end{align} 
% one can write
% \begin{align}\label{eq2.D.24}
% \omega_e=\frac{13.6\text{ eV}}{\hbar c}c\approx 10^{-2}\text{ \AA}^{-1}c.
% \end{align} 
% Now, the exchange of ``information'' between the ZPF of the two H--atoms must be faster than the electronic revolution period, namely (Fig. \ref{fig2.D.6})
%  \begin{align}\label{eq2.D.25}
%  \frac{2R}{c}\lesssim\frac{1}{\omega_e},
%  \end{align} 
%  leading to $R<50$ fm.
%       \begin{figure}[h]
%        \centerline{\includegraphics*[width=6cm,angle=0]{nutshell/figs/fig2D6_v2.pdf}}
%        \caption{Schematic representation of the periodic motion associated with the electron of the hydrogen atom and the (retarded) van der Waals interaction between two hydrogen atoms separated by a distance $R$.}\label{fig2.D.6}
%        \end{figure}
% Otherwise the frequencies of the two periodic motions (ZPF based dipole-dipole interaction and orbiting of the electron around the proton) would be similar and strong coupling between them would take place. In other words, there would be a strong damping of the retarded, dispersive contribution to the van der Waals interaction.
% 
% In keeping with the fact that the linear dimensions of an amino acid are, in average, 0.36 nm (3.6\AA), the typical distance between two residues in a protein in its native state is thus $\approx$ 10 \AA. One would then expect that the maximum number of amino acids of globular protein or of a folding domain, to be of the order of \mbox{(50 \AA/10 \AA)$^{3}\approx 125$}, as experimentally found\footnote{\cite{Rost:97}.}.
% \subsection{van der Waals between two amino acids}
% All of the commonly occurring amino acids in proteins have a central carbon atom ($C_\alpha$) to which is attached an hydrogen atom, an amino group (NH$_2$), and a carboxy (COOH) group (Fig. \ref{fig2.D.7}). What distinguishes one amino acid from another is the side chain attached to the $C_\alpha$ through its fourth valency. There are 20 different side chains specified by the genetic code.
% Amino acids are joined end to end during protein synthesis by the formation of peptide bonds. The carboxy group of the first amino acid condenses with the amino group of the next one to eliminate one molecule of water (thus the name residue, given also to aminoacids),  yield a peptide bond.
% 
% 
% The van der Waals interaction between two amino acids is,
%   \begin{align}\label{eq2.D.26}
%\Delta E^{(2)}=-\frac{6Z^2e^2(a_0)^5}{R^6}
%   \end{align} 
% where $Z$ is the number of protons of the molecule.
% \subsection{Average interaction between two side chains}
% Let us now estimate the average van der Waals interaction of two residues at a distance $R=8$ \AA from each other. For this purpose, use is made of $30\leq Z\leq 35$. One can then write,
%   \begin{align}\label{eq2.D.27}
%\nonumber \Delta E_{aa}^{(2)}&=-\frac{6\times Z^2\times 14.4\text{ eV \AA} (0.529\text{ \AA})^5}{(8\text{ \AA})^6}\\
%&=\left\{\begin{array}{c}
% -12.3\frac{\text{meV}}{\text{part}}=-0.28\frac{\text{kcal}}{\text{mole}},\\
%  -16.7\frac{\text{meV}}{\text{part}}=-0.38\frac{\text{kcal}}{\text{mole}},\\
%\end{array}\right. 
%   \end{align} 
% Thus
%    \begin{align}\label{eq2.D.28}
%\overline{\Delta E_{aa}^{(2)}}(8\text{ \AA})\approx-0.33\frac{\text{kcal}}{\text{mole}},
%    \end{align} 
% a quantity to be compared to $kT=0.6$ kcal/mole.
% 
% Summing up, the van der Waals interaction between amino acids is weak, of the order of $kT/2(\approx0.3 $ kcal/mole), with a range $\lesssim0.5$ nm.
%% \subsection*{Hindsight}
%% The van der Waals interaction is closely related to the restoration of spontaneous symmetry breaking of translational invariance (center of mass of finite systems like atoms and molecules define privileged positions in the otherwise homogeneous and isotropic vacuum), through ZPF of isoscalar and isovector character, some of which diverge although retaining a finite inertia (mass of the system) and associated emergent property, namely rigidity, pushing model; sloshing back and forth of opposite charges with very different spatial distributions (protons and electrons) thus essentially leading to a ground state displaying a low frequency dynamical dipole moment (See App. \ref{App1.D}, discussion following Eq. (\ref{eq1.D.4})). Of notice that a similar phenomenon is found in atomic nuclei, in the case of light exotic halo neutron dripline systems like e.g. $^{11}$Li (App. \ref{C2SF2}).

%\section[Phase transition and fluctuations]{Phase transition and fluctuations\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Anderson:84,Anderson:76,Anderson:64b}.}}\label{C2AppE}
%Empty space, considering also the quantal vacuum zero point fluctuations, is thought to be homogeneous and isotropic. Translational and rotational symmetry follows. But crystals, for example, of which all rocks are made, are neither homogeneous nor isotropic, displaying emergent properties like rigidity. Not only a crystal occupies and defines a fixed position and a privileged direction in space. Translational symmetry and isotropy is broken everywhere within it, in that the individual atoms all occupy fixed positions and varied groups of them define particular directions. Lattice phonons are the corresponding fluctuations associated and restoring the broken symmetries by the individual atoms, while translation and rotation of the crystal is associated with symmetry restoration of the system as a whole.
%
%
%Similarly, in a ferromagnetic crystal, where magnetization acquires a value different from zero below the Curie temperature breaking rotational invariance. In this case, spin waves are associated with symmetry restoration. In other words, another emergent property of spontaneous symmetry breaking --namely the fact that many--body systems can have ground states which do not have the same symmetry as the Hamiltonian itself-- aside from (generalized) rigidity, is the existence of long--wavelength collective motions of the order parameter (amplitude of density waves in a crystal, magnetization in a ferromagnet, etc.), such as phonons and spin waves. 
%
%  Superconductors break gauge symmetry, intimately related to charge and particle number conservation. A metallic superconductor has a rather perfect internal gauge phase order. Within this context, the BCS mechanism is most relevant to the mass problem because it introduces an energy (mass) gap for fermions, and the Goldstone--zero point motion of the total order parameter $\alpha_0$ which is large and rapid ($\dot\phi=\lambda/\hbar$; pairing rotational bands in  nuclei). Another major emergent property in broken symmetry systems is the appearance of singularities and texture of the order parameter like e.g. vortices in superfluid systems --namely, the possibility for a rotational invariant, spherical, quantal system to rotate (note van der Waals $1^-$ Cooper pair in $^{11}$Li, see Apps. \ref{C2SG2} and \ref{App6G})-- and of domain walls in ferromagnets.
%  
%  
%  Another feature of \textbf{spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB)} is the possibility of hierarchical\footnote{See \cite{Nambu:91}.} SSB or ``tumbling''. Namely, SSB can be a cause for another SSB at a lower energy scale, an example being the chain crystal-phonon-superconductivity, phonons (few meV) which induce the Cooper pairing of electrons ($T_c\approx0.5$ meV) and eventually to superconductivity.
%  
%  In the nuclear case, and in connection with the state $\ket{^{11}\text{Li}(gs)} $, one could argue that the incipient (dynamical) spontaneous symmetry breaking associated with the almost degeneracy of this state with a soft dipole\footnote{$E_x\lesssim1$ MeV, long wavelength $\lambda=2\pi R/L\approx 2\pi\times 4.58$ fm/1$\approx 29$ fm.} mode (pygmy dipole resonance\footnote{See \cite{Broglia:19} and refs. therein.}), allows for an incipient breaking of gauge invariance at the level of a single Cooper pair ($S_{2n}\approx380$ keV). The new feature in this case is the symbiotic character of the two incipient (dynamical) SSB phenomena.
%  \subsection{Pairing phase transition in small particles}
%  For bulk pure superconductors the large pair coherence length implies a very sharp, extremely narrow critical region as a function of the temperature (or of the magnetic field) so that, for example, the observed specific heat can be accurately described by the standard mean field BCS approach. However, the size of the critical region becomes larger as the dimensions of the system decreases below the coherence length. A limiting case corresponds   to particles with dimensions smaller than the coherence length which form essentially zero-dimensional systems\footnote{See \cite{Perenboom:81,Anderson:59,Kubo:62,Kubo:68,Muhlschlegel:72,Lauritzen:93}.}$^{,}$\footnote{An embodiment of such systems is provided by superfluid nuclei as a function of the rotational frequency (Fig. \ref{fig1.2}).}. An interesting question one may pose is for which size of particles will superconductivity actually cease. It was conjectured\footnote{\cite{Anderson:59}.} that the usual Cooper instability will not exist anymore and therefore superconductivity should disappear if the small superconducting particles are in the quantum--size--effect (QSE) regime when the energy difference $\delta$ between two discrete one--electron states is comparable to the energy of the superconducting state (Anderson criterion). This means that small superconductors with fewer than about $10^4$ to $10^5$ electrons should be affected by this effect.
%  Within this context, important information concerning pairing fluctuations is provided by the study of small Sn-particles at low temperatures\footnote{\cite{Perenboom:81}.}. To describe these fluctuations, use of techniques have been made that take into account large amplitude fluctuations of the order parameter. In particular the static--path approximation\footnote{\cite{Muhlschlegel:72}.} (SPA) with quadratic corrections\footnote{\cite{Lauritzen:93}. It is of notice that in \cite{Muhlschlegel:72}, the basic result of the work of the same authors (\cite{Denton:71}) on small normal--metal particles is mentioned to be the restriction to fixed electron number and the assertion is made that in the superconducting case (where they use the grand canonical ensemble) the above restriction to fixed electron number is expected to be even more important.} which mimic the RPA corrections known to be, aside from in a narrow interval around $T_c$ (or $H_c$; see Fig. \ref{fig1.2}), equivalent to number projection\footnote{\cite{Shimizu:90}.} . The relevant parameter of this sort of calculations is the ratio of $\delta$ and $kT_c$, i.e.
%  \begin{align}
%  \bar{\delta}=\frac{\delta}{kT_c}=\frac{2}{N(0)kT_c},
%  \end{align}
%where $N(0)$ is the single-particle energy density of one spin orientation states at the Fermi energy. In Fig. \ref{fig2.E.1} the results of the (SPA)+quadratic correction model for specific heat and spin susceptibility as a function of temperature is shown for $\bar{\delta}$ ranging from $\bar\delta=0.001$ to $\bar{\delta}=0.5$. The dashed curves show the static path results while the solid lines include the RPA-like corrections. For comparison, the BCS--results labeled by $\bar\delta=0$ corresponding to the bulk system are also displayed.
%
%
%For small values of $\bar\delta$ the system shows a sharp phase transition which can be well described by mean field theory. For $\bar\delta\approx0.5$, corresponding to a small number of particles ($\sim10^2$), the transition region has broadened so much as to blur the phase transition. RPA corrections are important only for relatively small particles.
%\subsection{Fine Sn particles}
%The electronic specific heat of small particles of Sn in a matrix with an average diameter ranging from 25 to 220 nm over a temperature range from 0.4 $T_c$ to $1.5T_c$ in zero magnetic field (Fig. \ref{fig2.E.2}) have been measured\footnote{See \cite{Perenboom:81} and references therein.}. In the same figure the results of the model discussed in the previous section is also shown.
%There is a good quantitative agreement between the results of the model and the experimental findings\footnote{For details we refer to \cite{Lauritzen:93} and \cite{Muhlschlegel:72}.}.
% \subsection{Time-reversal response function}
% To explain dirty superconductors a BCS type theory based on pairing in which each one-electron state pairs with its exact time reverse, a generalization of the $\mathbf k$ spin up, $-\mathbf k$ spin down pairing was developed\footnote{\cite{Anderson:59}. Of course such a formalism is standard in the nuclear case See e.g. \cite{Bohr:75,Bohr:88,Broglia:85b}.}. It could explain the experimental observation that starting with a pure single crystal of a superconducting material, there is usually a rather sharp initial drop in the superconducting transition temperature as the first small percentage of chemical imperfection is added. If the impurities which are introduced are ordinary ones, the sharp drop stops rather soon and is replaced by a more gradual behavior. On the other hand, if the introduced impurities are magnetic ions rather than ordinary chemical impurities, the initial drop continues, and superconductivity is eventually destroyed.
% 
% 
% In fact,  when time--reversal transformation cannot be made, that is, when the energy of the state $\ket{\nu}$ is not the same as the energy of $\ket{\bar\nu}$, a situation not found in the case of ordinary impurities which do not affect Kramer's degeneracy, pair correlation weakens, and the transition temperature will continue to drop as the degree of magnetic scattering increases. And within this scenario, one comes back again at what degree of (magnetic) scattering will superconductivity cease.
% 
% 
% It is of notice that the nucleus is itself a dirty superconductor in the sense that it can be viewed as a very fine particle --spatial quantization forcing it to be close to the QSE regime-- with only a very small number of Fermi particles in it, in which Cooper pairs are associated with $\ket{\nu\bar\nu}$ correlations. Thus, rapid rotation of the nucleus as a whole which affect differently the different originally Kramers degenerate orbits, can be viewed as introducing an ever increasing amount of magnetic impurities. The associated eventual superfluid--normal phase transition taking place for values of the angular momentum\footnote{See \cite{Bohr:75} and references therein. See also \cite{Brink:05} Ch. 6 Fig. 6.3 and refs. therein.} $\mathcal I_c\approx20\hbar$. Physically this band crossing between the superfluid $S$ (ground state based) and normal $N$ (pair vibration two--quasiparticle based) bands leads to the phenomenon known as back bending\footnote{\cite{Bohr:75,Stephens:72,Johnson:72}.}. Within the present scenario the $S-N$ phase transition in nuclei can be studied in term of individual quantal states. Although not  technically simple, two--nucleon transfer reactions induced by heavy ions can, in principle, be employed in such studies\footnote{\cite{Broglia:86,Shimizu:89}, Fig. 39.}.
