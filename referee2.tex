Answer to referee 2
\end{flushleft}
We now provide a detailed explanation of elastic and plastic nuclear behavior (footnote 3 p. 5) and a concrete example of why low--lying pairing vibrations are categorized as ``plastic modes'': their multipole excitation polarizes and eventually deforms (in gauge space), the closed shell system.

We thank the referee for having helped us at improving the paper.
