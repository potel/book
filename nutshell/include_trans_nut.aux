How can one get evidence for such an extended object? Hardly when the Cooper bag (balloon) is introduced in (\textbf  {b}) the mean field of a superfluid nucleus which, acting as an external field, constrains the Cooper pair to be within the nuclear radius with some spill out (long tail of Cooper pair, grey, shaded area extending outside the nuclear surface defined by $R_0=1.2A^{1/3}$ fm). But likely in situations like (\textbf  {c}), (\textbf  {d}), that is, in the case of two--nucleon transfer process (e.g. ($p,t$) reaction) in which the absolute cross section can change by orders of magnitude in going from pure two--particle (uncorrelated configurations) to long tail Cooper pair spill outs.

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.2.1}{\ignorespaces (\textbf  {a}) Schematic representation of independent--particle motion and (\textbf  {b}) independent--pair motion. In the first case nucleons (fermions) move independently of each other reflecting elastically from the wall of the mean field created by all the other nucleons, each of which is associated with a Wigner--Seitz cell of radius $d=\left ((4\pi /3)R_0^3/A\right )^{1/3}$ implying a relative distance of $2d$ (the actual numbers correspond to e.g. $^{120}$Sn). Switching on the pairing interaction (bare plus induced) leads to Cooper pair formation in which the correlation length is $\xi $. Thus, pair of nucleons moving in time reversal states close to the Fermi energy will tend to recede from each other lowering their relative momentum $(2d\rightarrow \xi )$ thus boosting the stability of the system, provided that the external mean field allows it. Or better, if there is nucleon density available to do so, something controlled to a large extent by the single--particle potential. From this point on, and at least for the levels lying close to the Fermi surface, one cannot talk about particles but about Cooper pairs (unless one does not intervene the system with an external field, e.g. $(p,d)$ and provides the energy, angular and linear momentum needed to break a pair). Of course that in the system to the right under the influence of an external field (like e.g. the HF of $^{120}$Sn), Cooper pairs will be constrained within its boundaries. But the picture displayed in (b) will be close to be representative in the case of two nuclei of $^{120}$Sn at a relative (CM) distance larger than $2R_0$ ($\approx 12$ fm), but still in weak contact. The pair field associated with a Cooper pair will extend from one to the other partner of the heavy ions participating in the reaction through the weakly overlapping interaction region, allowing two nucleons to correlate over a distance $\xi $ and, eventually, in a reaction like e.g. Sn+Sn$\rightarrow $ Sn(gs)+Sn(gs) allow for the transfer of two nucleons correlated over tens of fm.\relax }}{209}}
