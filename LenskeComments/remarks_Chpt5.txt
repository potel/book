Chpt. 5:
This chapter, together with chpt. 6, are covering an impressive amount of material! It will be of high value 
for everybody who is working actively on the theory of transfer reactions and the practical-numerical appliccations thereof.
Especially the very detailed discussionsin the appendices will be a big help for advanced students and experienced researchers. I like very much 
that you consider the wave functions of the transferred particles as entities, refraining from introducing the artificial concept of spectroscopic 
factors as independent quantities. 

Maybe I missed it: Reference to the book of Feshbach (Vol.2 Reaction Theory) might be added. Historically,
Tamura did a lot of fundamental work on the theory transfer reactions, esp. addressing and solving the non-orthogonality and non-locality 
problems of single and multiple particle transfer with complex projectiles. There are (at least) two Phys.Rept.'s from the 1970ies by
Tamura on these issues, as you might remember from your collaboration with him.

- Fig. 5.2.2: missing labels on all axes
- Fig. 5.H.1; misaligned, exceeds the page layout. Also, that figure is positioned in the references.
