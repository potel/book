Chpt. 6:
The general (enthusiastic) remarks in remarks on Chpt. 5 apply also to this chpater. The workout of 2nd order DWBA is 
highly appreciable. Both chapters together qualify in fact for a separate monograph!

- Eqs. 6.1.2 & 6.1.3.: Why do you introduce the A+2 particle wave fucntion as a Wood-Saxon eigenfunction already so early? 
At this point, wouldn't it be enough to say that it is defined as an overlap wave function and s such a matter of nuclear structure theory? 
If desired, one may certainly add that in practical calculations a widely used approach is to use W-S eigenfucntions. In genreal (later parts of that chapter), I'd refer to 
the W-S wave functions as part of the "practioneer's tool box".
- p. 427, 1st pargraph: check the defintion/decomposition of the triton wave function. The use of the same symbol (rho) for 
quite different objects is a bit misleading.  
- in App. 6.D, App. 6.E; and App. 6.F:  titles are printed by small letters, different from the use before and after,
- App. 6.H: the title is misaligned
