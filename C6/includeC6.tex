	 \epigraph{\dots physics is an experimental science: it is concerned only with those statements which in some sense can be verified by an experiment. The purpose of the theory is to provide an unification, a codification, or however you want to say it, of those results which can be tested by means of some experiment.}{J. Schwinger}
In what follows we present a derivation of the one--particle transfer differential cross section within the framework of the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA)\footnote{See \cite{Tobocman:61}, \cite{Austern:63}, \cite{Jackson:70} \citet{Satchler:80}, \cite{Satchler:83}, \cite{Austern:70}, \cite{Glendenning:04}, \cite{Thompson:09},  and refs. therein.}.



 The structure input in the calculations are, as a rule,  single-particle states dressed, within the formalism of nuclear field theory, through the coupling with the variety of collective, (quasi-) bosonic vibrations, leading to renormalized energies, particle content and  radial wavefunctions. With the help of the associated modified formfactors\footnote{See also \cite{Pinkston:82,Vaagen:79,Bang:80,Hamamoto:70} and refs. therein. See also \cite{Barranco:17}.}, and of global optical potentials, one can calculate the absolute differential cross sections, quantities which can  be directly compared with the experimental findings.
	
In this way one avoids to introduce, let alone use spectroscopic factors, quantities which are rather elusive to calculate consistently\footnote{\cite{Duguet:12,Jenning:11,Dickhoff:04,Dickhoff:05}, and refs. therein. See also \cite{Feshbach:92,Tamura:74,Tamura:80}.}. This is in keeping with the fact that as a nucleon moves through the nucleus it feels the presence of the other nucleons whose configurations change as the motion progresses. It takes time for this information to be feed back on the nucleon. This renders the average potential nonlocal in time\footnote{See \citet{Mahaux:85} and references therein, see also Sect. \ref{C6AppI}.}. A time-dependent operator can always be transformed into an energy-dependent operator, implying an $\omega$-dependence of the properties which are usually adscribed to particles like (effective) mass, charge, etc. Furthermore, due to  Pauli principle, the average potential is also non local in space.  Consequently, one is forced to deal with nucleons which carry around a cloud of (quasi) bosons, aside from  exchanging its position with that of the other nucleons, and thus with renormalized energies, single-particle amplitude content and radial wavefunctions (formfactors) which eventually result in a \textit{dynamical shell model}.  It is of notice that the above mentioned phenomena are not only found in nuclear physics, but are universal within the framework of many-body systems as well as of field theories like quantum electrodynamics (QED). In fact, a basic result of such theories is that nothing is really free\footnote{\cite{Feynman:75}.}.  Within this context, in Section \ref{C6S2.1} we provide examples of one-particle transfer processes in nuclei lying along the stability valley (Sn-isotopes), where strongly renormalized quasiparticle states are populated, while in 
 Sections \ref{C6S2}--\ref{S5.2.4} we give examples of exotic, halo nuclei.   Namely of the isotones $^{11}$Be and $^{10}$Li, displaying also strong renormalization effects, as testified by  the   phenomenon of parity inversion.

\caption{\idx{One-particle transfer!a) DWBA} NFT graphical representation of the one--particle transfer reaction $a(=b+1)+A\rightarrow b+B(=A+1)$. The time arrow is assumed to point upwards. The quantum numbers characterizing the states in which the transferred nucleon moves in projectile and target are denoted $a'_1$ and $a_1$ respectively. The interaction inducing the nucleon to be transferred can act either in the entrance channel ($(a,A);v_{1A}$, prior representation) or in the exit channel ($(b,B);v_{1b}$, post representation), in keeping with energy conservation. In the transfer process, the nucleon changes orbital at the same time that a change in the mass partition takes place. The corresponding relative motion mismatch is known as the recoil process, and is represented by a jagged curve (this is the recoil elementary mode, mode which couples to the particle degrees of freedom through a Galilean transformation operator). The recoil mode  provides information on the evolution of $r_{1A}$ ($r_{1b}$). In other words, on the coupling between structure and reaction (relative motion) degrees of freedom.}\label{fig6.1.1}
\end{figure}
We now proceed to derive the transition amplitude for the reaction (Fig. \ref{fig6.1.1}). 
\begin{equation}\label{eq_onept1}
    A+a(=b+1)\longrightarrow B(=A+1)+b.
\end{equation}
For a simplified version --no recoil plus plane wave limit (see also Sect. \ref{S4.1.2})-- we refer to Sect. \ref{C6AppE}, while for an alternative derivation within the framework of one-particle knock-out reactions we refer to Sect. \ref{C6AppF}.


Let us assume that the nucleon, bound initially to the core $b$ is in a single-particle state with orbital and total angular momentum $l_i$ and  $j_i$ respectively, and that the nucleon in the final state (bound to core $A$)  is in the $l_f,j_f$ state. The total spin and magnetic quantum numbers of nuclei $A,a,B,b$ are $\{J_A,M_A\},\{J_a,M_a\},\{J_B,M_B\},\{J_b,M_b\}$ respectively. Denoting $\xi_A$ and $\xi_b$ the intrinsic coordinates of the wavefunctions describing the structure of nuclei $A$ and $b$, and $\mathbf{r}_{An}$ and $\mathbf{r}_{bn}$ the relative coordinates of the transferred nucleon with respect to the CM of nuclei $A$ and $b$ respectively, one can write the ``intrinsic''  wavefunctions of the colliding nuclei $A,a$ as \idx{One-particle transfer!a) DWBA}
\begin{equation}\label{eq_onept2}
    \begin{split}
    &\phi_{M_A}^{J_A}(\xi_A),\\
    &\Psi(\xi_b,\mathbf{r}_{b1})=\sum_{m_i}\langle J_b\;j_i\;M_b\;m_i|J_a\;M_a\rangle\phi_{M_b}^{J_b}(\xi_b)\psi_{m_i}^{j_i}(\mathbf{r}_{bn},\sigma),
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
while the ``intrinsic'' wavefunctions describing the structure of nuclei $B$ and $b$ are
\begin{equation}\label{eq_onept3}
    \begin{split}
    &\phi_{M_b}^{J_b}(\xi_b),\\
    &\Psi(\xi_A,\mathbf{r}_{A1})=\sum_{m_f}\langle J_A\;j_f\;M_A\;m_f|J_B\;M_B\rangle\phi_{M_A}^{J_A}(\xi_A)\psi_{m_f}^{j_f}(\mathbf{r}_{An},\sigma).
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
For an unpolarized incident beam (sum over $M_A,M_a$ and divide  by $(2J_A+1),(2J_a+1)$), and assuming that  one does not detect the final polarization (sum over $M_B,M_b$), the differential cross section in the DWBA can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq_onept4}
    \begin{split}
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}&=\frac{k_f}{k_i}\frac{\mu_i\mu_f}{4\pi^2\hbar^4}\frac{1}{(2J_A+1)(2J_a+1)}\\
&\times\sum_{\substack{M_A,M_a\\M_B,M_b}}\left|\sum_{m_i,m_f}\langle J_b\;j_i\;M_b\;m_i|J_a\;M_a\rangle\langle J_A\;j_f\;M_A\;m_f|J_B\;M_B\rangle T_{m_i,m_f}\right|^2,
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $k_i$ and $k_f$ are the relative motion linear momentum in both initial and final channels (flux), while $\mu_i$ and $\mu_f$ are the corresponding relative masses. The two quantities within $\langle\;\rangle$ brackets are Clebsch--Gordan coefficients taking care of angular momentum conservation\footnote{\cite{Brink:68} and \cite{Edmonds:60}, also \cite{Bohr:69}.}.


The transition amplitude $T_{m_i,m_f}$ is
\begin{equation}\label{eq_onept5}
T_{m_i,m_f}=\sum_\sigma\int d\mathbf{r}_fd\mathbf{r}_{bn}\chi^{(-)*}(\mathbf{r}_f)
\psi_{m_f}^{j_f*}(\mathbf{r}_{An},\sigma)V(r_{bn})\psi_{m_i}^{j_i}(\mathbf{r}_{bn},\sigma)\chi^{(+)}(\mathbf{r}_i),
\end{equation}
where \idx{One-particle transfer!a) DWBA}
\begin{equation}\label{eq_onept12}
\psi_{m_i}^{j_i}(\mathbf{r}_{An},\sigma)=u_{j_i}(r_{bn})\left[ Y^{l_i} (\hat r_i)\chi(\sigma)\right]_{j_i m_i},
\end{equation}
is the single--particle wavefunction describing the motion of the nucleon  to be transferred, when in the initial state, $u,Y$ and $\chi$ being the radial, angular (spherical harmonics) and spin components. Similarly for $\psi_{m_f}^{j_f}$. 
The distorted waves describing the relative motion of the incoming projectile and of the target nucleus and of the outgoing system and the residual nucleus are,
 \begin{equation}\label{eq_onept6}
\chi^{(+)}(\mathbf{k}_i,\mathbf{r}_i)= \frac{ 4\pi }{k_i r_i}\sum_{l'} i^{l'}
e^{i\sigma_i^{l'}} g_{l'}(\hat r_i) \left[ Y^{l'} (\hat r_i) Y^{l'} (\hat k_i)\right]^0_0,
\end{equation}
and
 \begin{equation}\label{eq_onept7}
\chi^{(-)*}(\mathbf{k}_f,\mathbf{r}_f)= \frac{ 4\pi }{k_f r_f}\sum_{l} i^{-l}
e^{i\sigma_f^{l}} f_{l}  (\hat r_f) \left[ Y^{l} (\hat r_f) Y^{l} (\hat k_f)\right]^0_0,
\end{equation}
respectively. In the above relations $f$ and $g$ are, respectively, the solutions of the radial Schr\"odinger equation  describing the relative motion  associated with the corresponding optical potential  (``elastic'' scattering) in entrance and exit channel. Let us now discuss the angular components involved in the reaction process, starting with the relation \idx{One-particle transfer!a) DWBA}
\begin{equation}\label{eq_onept8}
    \begin{split}
\left[ Y^{l} (\hat r_f) Y^{l} (\hat k_f)\right]^0_0&\left[ Y^{l'} (\hat r_i) Y^{l'} (\hat k_i)\right]^0_0=\sum_K \bigl((l l)_0(l' l')_0|(l l')_K(l l')_K\bigr)_0\\
&\times \left\{\left[ Y^{l} (\hat r_f) Y^{l'} (\hat r_i)\right]^K\left[ Y^{l} (\hat k_f) Y^{l'} (\hat k_i)\right]^K\right\}^0_0.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
The $9j$--symbol can be explicitly evaluated to give,
\begin{equation}\label{eq_onept9}
\bigl((l l)_0(l' l')_0|(l l')_K(l l')_K\bigr)_0=\sqrt{\frac{2K+1}{(2l+1)(2l'+1)}},
\end{equation}
while the coupled expression can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq_onept10}
    \begin{split}
\left\{\vphantom{\left[ Y^{l} (\hat r_f) Y^{l'} (\hat r_i)\right]^K}\right.&\left.\left[ Y^{l} (\hat r_f) Y^{l'} (\hat r_i)\right]^K\left[ Y^{l} (\hat k_f) Y^{l'} (\hat k_i)\right]^K\right\}^0_0=\sum_M \langle K\;K\;M\;-M|0\;0\rangle
 \left[ Y^{l} (\hat r_f) Y^{l'} (\hat r_i)\right]^K_M\\
 &\times\left[ Y^{l} (\hat k_f) Y^{l'} (\hat k_i)\right]^K_{-M}=\sum_M\frac{(-1)^{K+M}}{\sqrt{2K+1}}\left[ Y^{l} (\hat r_f) Y^{l'} (\hat r_i)\right]^K_M
\left[ Y^{l} (\hat k_f) Y^{l'} (\hat k_i)\right]^K_{-M}.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Thus,
\begin{equation}\label{eq_onept11}
    \begin{split}
\left[ Y^{l} (\hat r_f) Y^{l} (\hat k_f)\right]^0_0&\left[ Y^{l'} (\hat r_i) Y^{l'} (\hat k_i)\right]^0_0\\
&=\sum_{K,M}\frac{(-1)^{K+M}}{\sqrt{(2l+1)(2l'+1)}}\left[ Y^{l} (\hat r_f) Y^{l'} (\hat r_i)\right]^K_M
\left[ Y^{l} (\hat k_f) Y^{l'} (\hat k_i)\right]^K_{-M}.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
For the angular integral to be different from zero, the integrand must be coupled to zero angular momentum (scalar). Noting that the only  variables over which one integrates in the above expression  are $\hat r_i,\hat r_f$, we have to couple the remaining functions of the angular variables, namely the wavefunctions \idx{One-particle transfer!a) DWBA} $\psi_{m_f}^{j_f*}(\mathbf{r}_{An},\sigma)=(-1)^{j_f-m_f}\psi_{-m_f}^{j_f}(\mathbf{r}_{An},-\sigma)$ and $\psi_{m_i}^{j_i}(\mathbf{r}_{bn},\sigma)$ to angular momentum $K$, as well as to fulfill $M=m_f-m_i$. Let us then consider
\begin{multline}\label{eq_onept35}
(-1)^{j_f-m_f}\psi_{-m_f}^{j_f}(\mathbf{r}_{An},-\sigma)\psi_{m_i}^{j_i}(\mathbf{r}_{bn},\sigma)=
(-1)^{j_f-m_f}u_{j_f}(r_{An})u_{j_i}(r_{bn})\\
\times \sum_P \langle j_f\;j_i\;-m_f\;m_i|P\;m_i-m_f\rangle \left\{\left[ Y^{l_f}(\hat r_{An}) \chi^{1/2}(-\sigma)\right]^{j_f}\left[ Y^{l_i}(\hat r_{bn}) \chi^{1/2}(\sigma)\right]^{j_i}\right\}^P_{m_i-m_f}.
\end{multline}
Recoupling the spherical harmonics to angular momentum $K$ and the spinors to $S=0$, only one term survives the angular integral in (\ref{eq_onept5}), namely

\begin{multline}\label{eq_onept34}
(-1)^{j_f-m_f}u_{j_f}(r_{An})u_{j_i}(r_{bn})\bigl((l_f \tfrac{1}{2})_{j_f}(l_i \tfrac{1}{2})_{j_i}|(l_f l_i)_K(\tfrac{1}{2} \tfrac{1}{2})_0\bigr)_K\\
 \times\langle j_f\;j_i\;-m_f\;m_i|K\;m_i-m_f\rangle\left[Y^{l_f}(\hat r_{An})  Y^{l_i}(\hat r_{bn}) \right]^{K}_{m_i-m_f}\left[ \chi(-\sigma)\chi(\sigma)\right]^0_0.
\end{multline}
\idx{One-particle transfer!a) DWBA}
Making use of the fact that the sum over spins yields a factor $-\sqrt{2}$, and in keeping with the fact that $M=m_f-m_i$, one obtains,
\begin{multline}\label{eq_onept14}
T_{m_i,m_f}=(-1)^{j_f-m_f}\frac{-16\sqrt{2}\pi^2}{k_fk_i}\sum_{ll'}i^{l'-l}e^{\sigma_f^l+\sigma_i^{l'}}\sum_K\bigl((l_f \tfrac{1}{2})_{j_f}(l_i \tfrac{1}{2})_{j_i}|(l_f l_i)_K(\tfrac{1}{2} \tfrac{1}{2})_0\bigr)_K\\
\times\langle j_f\;j_i\;-m_f\;m_i|K\;m_i-m_f\rangle\left[ Y^{l} (\hat k_f) Y^{l'} (\hat k_i)\right]^K_{m_i-m_f}\int d\mathbf{r}_fd\mathbf{r}_{bn}\frac{f_l(r_f)g_{l'}(r_i)}{r_fr_i}\\
\times u_{j_f}(r_{An})u_{j_i}(r_{bn})V(r_{bn})
(-1)^{K+m_f-m_i}\left[ Y^{l} (\hat r_f) Y^{l'} (\hat r_i)\right]^K_{m_f-m_i}\left[ Y^{l_f}(\hat r_{An}) Y^{l_i}(\hat r_{bn})\right]^K_{m_i-m_f}.
\end{multline}
Again, the only term of the expression
\begin{multline*}
(-1)^{K+m_f-m_i}\left[ Y^{l} (\hat r_f) Y^{l'} (\hat r_i)\right]^K_{m_f-m_i}\left[ Y^{l_f}(\hat r_{An}) Y^{l_i}(\hat r_{bn})\right]^K_{m_i-m_f}=\\
(-1)^{K+m_f-m_i}\sum_P \langle K\;K\;m_f-m_i\;m_i-m_f|P\;0\rangle\left\{\left[ Y^{l} (\hat r_f) Y^{l'} (\hat r_i)\right]^K\left[ Y^{l_f}(\hat r_{An}) Y^{l_i}(\hat r_{bn})\right]^K\right\}^P_0
\end{multline*}
which survives after angular integration is the one with $P=0$, that is,\idx{One-particle transfer!a) DWBA}
\begin{multline*}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{(2K+1)}}\left\{\left[ Y^{l} (\hat r_f) Y^{l'} (\hat r_i)\right]^K\left[ Y^{l_f}(\hat r_{An}) Y^{l_i}(\hat r_{bn})\right]^K\right\}^0_0\\
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(2K+1)}}\sum_{M_K}\langle K\;K\;M_K\;-M_K|0\;0\rangle\left[ Y^{l} (\hat r_f) Y^{l'} (\hat r_i)\right]^K_{M_K}\\
\times\left[ Y^{l_f}(\hat r_{An}) Y^{l_i}(\hat r_{bn})\right]^K_{-M_K}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(2K+1)}}\sum_{M_K}\frac{(-1)^{K+M_K}}{\sqrt{(2K+1)}}\left[ Y^{l} (\hat r_f) Y^{l'} (\hat r_i)\right]^K_{M_K}\\
\times\left[ Y^{l_f}(\hat r_{An}) Y^{l_i}(\hat r_{bn})\right]^K_{-M_K}\\
=\frac{1}{2K+1}\sum_{M_K}(-1)^{K+M_K}\left[ Y^{l} (\hat r_f) Y^{l'} (\hat r_i)\right]^K_{M_K}\left[ Y^{l_f}(\hat r_{An}) Y^{l_i}(\hat r_{bn})\right]^K_{-M_K},
\end{multline*}
an expression which is spherically symmetric. One can evaluate it for a particular configuration, for example setting $\hat r_f=\hat z$ and the center of mass $A,b,n$  in the $x-z$ plane (see Fig. \ref{fig1}). Once the orientation in space of this ``standard'' configuration is specified (through, for example, a rotation $0\leq\alpha\leq 2\pi$ around $\hat z$, a rotation $0\leq\beta\leq \pi$ around the new $x$ axis and a rotation $0\leq\gamma\leq 2\pi$ around $\hat r_{bB}$), the only remaining angular coordinate is $\theta$, while the integral over the other three angles yields   $8\pi^2$. Setting $\hat r_f=\hat z$ one obtains
\begin{equation}\label{eq_onept18}
\left[ Y^{l} (\hat r_f) Y^{l'} (\hat r_i)\right]^K_{M_K}=\langle l\;l'\;0\;M_K|K\;M_K\rangle\sqrt{\frac{2l+1}{4\pi}}Y_{M_K}^{l'}(\hat r_i).
\end{equation}
Because of $M=m_i-m_f$, and $m=m_f$,  $T_{m_i,m_f}\equiv T_{m,M} $ where
\begin{multline}\label{eq_onept19}
T_{m,M}=(-1)^{j_f-m}\frac{-64\sqrt{2}\pi^{7/2}}{k_f k_i}\sum_{ll'}i^{l'-l}e^{\sigma_f^l+\sigma_i^{l'}}\sqrt{2l+1}\sum_K\frac{(-1)^{K}}{2K+1}\bigl((l_f \tfrac{1}{2})_{j_f}(l_i \tfrac{1}{2})_{j_i}|(l_f l_i)_K(\tfrac{1}{2} \tfrac{1}{2})_0\bigr)_K\\
\times\langle j_f\;j_i\;-m\;M+m|K\;M\rangle\left[ Y^{l} (\hat k_f) Y^{l'} (\hat k_i)\right]^K_{M}\int d\mathbf{r}_fd\mathbf{r}_{bn}\frac{f_l(r_f)g_{l'}(r_i)}{r_fr_i}\\
\times u_{j_f}(r_{An})u_{j_i}(r_{bn})V(r_{bn})
\sum_{M_K}(-1)^{M_K}\langle l\;l'\;0\;M_K|K\;M_K\rangle \left[ Y^{l_f}(\hat r_{An}) Y^{l_i}(\hat r_{bn})\right]^K_{-M_K}Y_{M_K}^{l'}(\hat r_i).
\end{multline}


\idx{One-particle transfer!a) DWBA}
We now turn our attention to the sum
\begin{equation}\label{eq_onept20}
\sum_{\substack{M_A,M_a\\M_B,M_b}}\left|\sum_{m,M}\langle J_b\;j_i\;M_b\;m|J_a\;M_a\rangle\langle J_A\;j_f\;M_A\;M|J_B\;M_B\rangle T_{m,M}\right|^2,
\end{equation}
appearing in the expression for the differential cross section (\ref{eq_onept4}). For any given value $m',M'$ of $m,M$, the sum will be
\begin{multline}\label{eq_onept21}
\sum_{M_a,M_b}\left|\langle J_b\;j_i\;M_b\;m'|J_a\;M_a\rangle\right|^2\sum_{M_A,M_B}\left|\langle J_A\;j_f\;M_A\;M'|J_B\;M_B\rangle\right|^2 \left|T_{m',M'}\right|^2\\
=\frac{(2J_a+1)(2J_B+1)}{(2j_i+1)(2j_f+1)}\sum_{M_a,M_b}\left|\langle J_b\;J_a\;M_b\;-M_a|j_i\;m'\rangle\right|^2\\
\times\sum_{M_A,M_B}\left|\langle J_A\;J_B\;M_A\;-M_B|j_f\;M'\rangle\right|^2 \left|T_{m',M'}\right|^2,
\end{multline}
by virtue of the symmetry property of Clebsch--Gordan coefficients
\begin{equation}\label{eq_onept22}
\langle J_b\;j_i\;M_b\;m|J_a\;M_a\rangle=(-1)^{J_b-M_b}\sqrt{\frac{(2J_a+1)}{(2j_i+1)}}\langle J_b\;J_a\;M_b\;-M_a|j_i\;m\rangle.
\end{equation}
The sum over the Clebsch--Gordan coefficients in (\ref{eq_onept21}) is equal to 1, so (\ref{eq_onept20}) becomes
 \begin{equation}\label{eq_onept23}
\frac{(2J_a+1)(2J_B+1)}{(2j_i+1)(2j_f+1)}\sum_{m,M}\left|T_{m,M}\right|^2,
\end{equation}
and the differential cross section  can be written as,\idx{One-particle transfer!a) DWBA}
\begin{equation}\label{eq_onept24} 
    \begin{split}
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}&=\frac{k_f}{k_i}\frac{\mu_i\mu_f}{4\pi^2\hbar^4}
\frac{(2J_B+1)}{(2j_i+1)(2j_f+1)(2J_A+1)}\sum_{m,M}\left| T_{m,M}\right|^2.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{eq_onept25}
T_{m,M}=\sum_{Kll'}(-1)^{-m}\langle j_f\;j_i\;-m\;M+m|K\;M\rangle\left[ Y^{l} (\hat k_f) Y^{l'} (\hat k_i)\right]^K_{M}t_{ll'}^K.
\end{equation}
Orienting $\hat k_i$ along the incident $z$--direction leads to, \idx{One-particle transfer!a) DWBA}


	
\begin{equation}\label{eq_onept26}
\left[ Y^{l} (\hat k_f) Y^{l'} (\hat k_i)\right]^K_{M}=\langle l\;l'\;M\;0|K\;M\rangle\sqrt{\frac{2l'+1}{4\pi}}Y_{M}^{l}(\hat k_f),

and

\subsection{Coordinates}
To perform the integral in (\ref{eq_onept28}), one needs the expression of $r_i,r_{An},\hat r_{An},\hat r_{bn},\hat r_i$ in term of the integration variables $r_f,r_{bn},\theta$. Because one is interested in evaluating these quantities in the particular configuration depicted in Fig. \ref{fig1}, one has
\begin{align}
\mathbf{r}_f&=r_f \,\hat z,\\
\mathbf{r}_{bn}&=-r_{bn}(\sin \theta \,\hat x+ \cos \theta  \,\hat z),\\
\mathbf{r}_{Bn}&=\mathbf{r}_f+\mathbf{r}_{bn}=-r_{bn}\sin \theta \,\hat x+(r_f-r_{bn}\cos \theta)\,\hat z.
\end{align}
One can then write
\begin{align}
\mathbf{r}_{An}&=\frac{A+1}{A}\mathbf{r}_{Bn}=-\frac{A+1}{A}r_{bn}\sin \theta \,\hat x+\frac{A+1}{A}(r_f-r_{bn}\cos \theta)\,\hat z,\\
\mathbf{r}_{an}&=\frac{b}{b+1}\mathbf{r}_{bn}=-\frac{b}{b+1}r_{bn}(\sin \theta \,\hat x+ \cos \theta  \,\hat z),
\end{align}
and

\section{Examples and Applications}
  In the calculation of absolute reaction cross sections two elements melt together: reaction and structure.
  In the case of weakly coupled probes like, as a rule, direct one--particle transfer processes are, the first element can be further divided into two essentially separated components: elastic scattering (optical potentials), and transfer amplitudes connecting entrance and exit channels. In other words, the habitat of DWBA.

    \idx{One-particle transfer!b) absolute differential cross sections (unifying structure and reactions)!Sn-isotopes (light ions)}
  The NFT calculation of the structure properties of the Sn-isotopes probed through $(d,p)$ and $(p,d)$ reactions, were carried out making use of an effective Skyrme interaction\footnote{\cite{Chabanat:97}.}, SLy4, to determine the mean field (HFB) and the collective modes (QRPA), and a $v_{14}(^1S_0)(\equiv v_p^{bare})$ Argonne pairing interaction\footnote{\cite{Wiringa:84}.}. Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) results provide the bare quasiparticle spectrum, while QRPA a realization of density $(J^\pi=2^+,3^-,4^+,5^-)$ and spin $(2^\pm,3^\pm,4^\pm,5^\pm)$ modes.
  
  Taking into account renormalization processes (self-energy, vertex corrections) in terms of the PVC mechanism, the dressed particles and the induced pairing interaction $v_{p}^{ind}$ were calculated. Adding it to $v^{bare}_p$  the total pairing interaction $v_p^{eff}$ was determined. It is found that $v_p^{bare}$ and $v_p^{ind}$ contribute about equally to the state dependent pairing gap.
  
  Making use of the above input, the lowest order NFT renormalizing diagrams (self-energy and vertex correction) were propagated to infinite order making use of Nambu-Gorkov equation.
  In Fig. \ref{fig6.2.1}, the absolute differential cross section associated with the population of the low-lying state $|^{119}\text{Sn}(7/2^+;788 \text{keV})\rangle$ in the one-particle pick-up process $^{120}$Sn$(p,d)^{119}$Sn and  worked out with the help of the code \textsc{one}\footnote{\cite{Potel:12b}; see also App. \ref{C8AppD}.}, of global optical parameters\footnote{\cite{Dickey:82}.} and of NFT spectroscopic amplitudes, is compared with the experimental data.

The theoretical prediction (continuous curve) is displayed in comparison with the experimental data (solid dots,  \cite{Dickey:82}). The corresponding integrated cross sections are 5.0 and 5.2$\pm0.6$ mb respectively. In the inset, and for the sake of accuracy control, the absolute differential cross sections associated with the reaction $^{124}$Sn$(p,d)^{123}$Sn(gs) calculated making use of the codes \textsc{one} (bold dashed) and \textsc{fresco} (thin continuous line (\cite{Thompson:88})) are displayed. }\label{fig6.2.1}
    \end{figure}
  Similar calculations have been carried for the reaction $^{120}$Sn$(d,p)^{121}$Sn $(j^{\pi};E_x)$ in connection with the population 	of the $|3/2^+; \text{gs}\rangle$ and $|11/2^-;E_x\approx 0\, \text{MeV}\rangle$ states.
  In the stripping  experiment\footnote{\cite{Bechara:75}.} the 	ground state and the $11/2^-$ state were not resolved in energy. This is the reason why theory and experiment are  compared to the data for the summed $l=2+5$ differential cross section (see Fig. \ref{fig6.2.2} (a)), the separate theoretical predictions been displayed in Figs. \ref{fig6.2.2} (b) and (c).

    
    
  Let us now turn to the most fragmented low-lying quasiparticle state around $^{120}$Sn, namely that associated with the $d_{5/2}$ orbital As shown in the right panel of Fig. \ref{fig6.2.3} five low-lying $5/2^+$ states have been populated in the 	reaction  $^{120}$Sn$(p,d)^{119}$Sn with a summed cross section\footnote{\cite{Dickey:82}.} $\sum_{i=1}^5 \sigma(2^\circ-25^\circ)\approx 8$ mb$\pm 2$ mb  while four are theoretically predicted with $\sum_{i=1}^4\sigma(2^\circ-25^\circ)= 6.2$ mb.
  Within the  present context, namely that of probing the single--particle 	content of an elementary excitation (coupling to doorway states\footnote{\cite{Feshbach:58}, \cite{Rawitscher:87}, \cite{Bortignon:81}, \cite{Bertsch:83}.}), the study of the $5/2^+$ quasiparticle strength is a rather trying situation, providing a measure of the limitations encountered in such studies. 
  
  
  Analysis of the type presented above allows one to posit that structure and reactions are but just two aspects of the same physics. If one adds to this picture the fact that the optical potential --that is, the energy and momentum dependent nuclear dielectric function describing the medium 	where direct nuclear chemistry reactions take place-- can be calculated microscopically\footnote{See footnote \ref{f21c1} Ch. \ref{introduction}.} in terms of the same elements entering structure calculations (i.e. spectroscopic amplitudes, renormalized single-particle wavefunctions and transition densities and thus effective formfactors), the structure-reaction circle closes itself.
  Allowing  halo nuclei to be part of the daily nuclear structure paradigm, the equivalence between structure and reactions becomes even stronger, in keeping with the central role the continuum plays in the structure of these nuclei\footnote{For example, in the case of $^{10}$Li (see Sect. \ref{S5.2.4}) in which one is confronted with continuum spectroscopy, the self-energy functional describing the interweaving of the unbound neutron with vibrations of the core ($^9$Li), contribute both to the nuclear structure and nuclear reaction dielectric function.}.

    \end{figure}
  
  It seems then fair to state that the importance of the coupled channels approach to reactions\footnote{ \cite{Thompson:88}, \cite{Thompson:13}, \cite{Tamura:70}, \cite{Ascuitto:69}, \cite{Ascuitto:70}, \cite{Ascuitto:71}, \cite{Ascuitto:72}; cf. also \cite{Fernandez:10}, \cite{Fernandez:10b}.} is not so much, or at least not only, that it is able to handle situations like for example one--particle transfer to members of a quadrupole rotational band, alas at the expenses of including effects to all orders which can be treated in lowest one\footnote{Within this context see e.g. the couple channel Born approximation treatment of $^{208}$Pb$(t,p)^{210}$Pb($3^-$) carried out in \cite{Flynn:72b}.}, but that it reminds us how intimately connected  probed and probe are in nuclei.
  
  
  
  
  On the other hand, for most of the situations dealt with in the present monograph, it is transparent the power, also to reflect the physics, of the approach based in perturbative DWBA (e.g. 1st order for one--nucleon transfer and 2nd for Cooper pair tunneling), coupled  
  with NFT elementary modes of nuclear excitation.
  To which extent a \textsc{fresco} like software built on a NFT basis will ever be attempted is an open question. Note in any case the important attempts made at incorporating so called core excitations within the \textsc{fresco} framework\footnote{\cite{Fernandez:10}, \cite{Fernandez:10b}.}. 
  
  
  We conclude this section by recalling the fact that the dressing of single particles with pairing vibrations plays also an important role in the structure properties of nuclei\footnote{\cite{Barranco:87b}, \cite{Bes:88}, \cite{Baroni:04}.}.
  
  \subsection{NFT of $^{11}$Be: one--particle transfer in halo nuclei}\label{C6S2}
  \idx{Renormalized NFT!halo nucleus: $^{11}$Be}
  The nucleus $^{11}_4$Be$_7$ constitutes an example of one--neutron halo system, namely a halo neutron outside the $N=6$ closed shell resulting from the phenomenon of parity inversion\footnote{\label{f21C5}This nucleus has been extensively studied both experimentally (see \cite{Iwasaki:00,Fortier:99,Winfield:01,Auton:70,Zwieglinski:79,Schmitt:13,Nortershauser:09,Kwan:14}  and references therein) and theoretically (see \cite{Talmi:60,Otsuka:93,Sagawa:93,Vinh:95,Gori:04,Nunes:96,Fossez:16,Hamamoto:07,Kanada:02,Calci:16,Krieger:12,Timofeyuk:99,Keeley:04,Deltuva:09,Deltuva:13,Lay:14,deDiego:14} and references therein).}
  
  \subsubsection[Outlook]{Outlook\footnote{\cite{Barranco:17}.}}
  In the core of $^{11}$Be, namely $^{10}_{4}$Be$_{6}$, six neutrons occupy the $1s_{1/2}$ and 1$p_{3/2}$ levels (Fig. \ref{fig6.2.1x}). The 
  dominant ZPF is of quadrupole type, the main neutron  component being  the 
  $((p_{1/2},p^{-1}_{3/2})\otimes 2^+)_{0^+}$ one . Because $\epsilon_{p1/2} -
  \epsilon_{p3/2}\approx 3.35 $ MeV and $\hbar \omega_{2^+} =$3.368 MeV, the largest 
  amplitude of the quadrupole mode is associated with the particle-hole excitation $(p_{1/2},p^{-1}_{3/2})_{2^+}$.
  
  
   The effect of dressing the $p_{1/2}$ state with the quadrupole vibration, amounts essentially to a Pauli principle correction. It results from the exchange of the $p_{1/2}$ nucleon considered explicitly and that participating in the vibration. The corresponding repulsion amounts to
    $\approx 2.8$ MeV (Fig. \ref{fig6.2.1x}  inset (\textbf{A})).  
  The clothing of the $2s_{1/2}$ bare level by the quadrupole mode
  (Fig. \ref{fig6.2.1x} inset (\textbf{B})) makes it  heavier, 
  lowering its energy by almost one-half MeV (0.43 MeV). The result of the two processes  
  is parity inversion  and the  appearance of  the $N=6$ new magic number together with the melting 
  away of the $N=8$ standard one.
  In a similar way  in which the Lamb shift  (Fig. \ref{fig6.2.1x}, inset (\textbf{C}))  provides a measure 
  of  the fluctuations of the QED vacuum\footnote{\cite{Pais:86} p. 451.},  parity inversion 
  measures ZPF of the nuclear vacuum (ground) state.

  \end{figure} 

  \subsubsection{Calculations}
  
  
  In the calculations one has simultaneously dealt with the $1p_{3/2}, 1p_{1/2}, 2s_{1/2}$ and $1d_{5/2}$ valence
  single-particle states,
  treating their interweaving with the low--lying quadrupole collective vibration
  of the $^{10}$Be core and  the mixing 
  between bound and continuum states.   
  The bare energies of the single-particle orbitals were determined by freely varying the depth, diffusivity, radius and spin-orbit strength of a Woods--Saxon potential so that, making use of an effective radial dependent effective mass ($m_k(r=0)=0.7m, m_k(r=\infty)=0.91m$), the fully dressed, renormalized energies best reproduce the experimental findings\footnote{Namely, parallel to mass renormalization in QED (see Sect. \ref{S6.6}).}.  
  
  
  The variety of self energy diagrams, renormalizing selfconsistently  
  the motion 
  of the odd neutron of $^{11}$Be in both configuration-- (Fig. \ref{fig6.2.3x}) 
  and conformational 3D-space (Fig. \ref{fig6.3.1}, form factors), through the coupling to quadrupole vibrations, have been worked out\footnote{The results, obtained taking also into account the coupling to the octupole vibration and the pair removal mode of the core $^{10}$Be is shown in Fig. \ref{fig6.3.1}. Their effect in the present case are rather small, and the final results are rather similar to the ones discussed in this Section (for details see \cite{Barranco:17}, supplemental material).}.
  The resulting states can be written as 
  \begin{align}\label{eq6.2.1}
  \ |\widetilde{1/2^+} \rangle  =  \sqrt{0.80} |s_{1/2}\rangle + \sqrt{0.20} |(d_{5/2}\otimes 2^+)_{1/2^+}\rangle,    
  \end{align}
  \idx{Renormalized NFT!halo nucleus: $^{11}$Be}
  \begin{align}\label{eq6.2.2}
  |\widetilde{1/2^-}\rangle =  \sqrt{0.84} |(p_{1/2}\rangle + \sqrt{0.16} |(p_{1/2},p^{-1}_{3/2})_{2^+}
  \otimes 2^+)_{0+}, p_{1/2}\rangle, 
  \end{align}
  and
  \begin{align}\label{eq6.2.3}
  |\widetilde{5/2^+}\rangle  =\sqrt{0.49} |d_{5/2}\rangle+ \sqrt{0.23}|(s_{1/2}\otimes 2^+)_{5/2^+} \rangle  
  + \sqrt{0.28} |(d_{5/2}\otimes 2^+)_{5/2^+} \rangle. 
  \end{align}  
  The  bare energies $\epsilon_j$ and the ($(NFT)_{ren}$) values  $\tilde \epsilon_j$ 
  associated with the renormalised single-particle states 
  are shown in Fig. \ref{fig6.2.1x}. These last quantities reproduce quite accurately the experimental findings (Fig. \ref{fig6.3.1}, upper center). Also shown in this figure, are the corresponding wavefunctions $\phi_j(r)$ and $\tilde \phi_j(r)$.
  The  form factors $\tilde\phi_j(r)$  were used,  
  together with  global optical  potentials\footnote{\cite{Han:06,Koning:03}.}, to calculate the one-nucleon stripping and pickup absolute differential 
  cross sections of the reactions $^{10}$Be$(d,p)^{11}$Be$(1/2^+,1/2^-$, and $5/2^+$) and $^{11}$Be$(p,d)^{10}$Be($2^+$). The results provide an overall account  of the experimental findings. It is of notice that the $d_{5/2}$ plays, through its coupling to the $2^+$ state, an essential role in the parity inversion phenomenon, by lowering the energy of the $s_{1/2}$ state in a consistent way. The numbers quoted below also contain important contributions from Pauli principle correcting diagrams see Fig. \ref{fig6.3.1} (IV) associated with the presence of two-phonon quadrupole states in intermediate, virtual configurations.
  
  
  \idx{Renormalized NFT!halo nucleus: $^{11}$Be}
  We remark that  the stripping process shown in inset
  (A$_1$) of Fig. \ref{fig6.2.3x} and populating $^{11}$Be ground state  implies the action of
  the external $(d,p)$ field on the left hand side of the graphical representation of Dyson equation shown in Fig, 
  \ref{fig6.2.3x}(I), and involves, at the same time, the use of the corresponding radial wavefunction
  as form factor (Fig. \ref{fig6.3.1} (a)). 
  In the case of the population of the first $2^+$ excited state of $^{10}$Be (inset $A_2$), a $(p,d)$ field acts on the 
  $(d_{5/2} \otimes 2^+)_{1/2^+}$ virtual state of the second graph of the right hand side   of Dyson equation
  (Fig. \ref{fig6.2.3x} (I) (a)), \textit{involving this time the radial wave function 
  $\tilde \phi^{(2+)}_{1/2^+}$(r), namely the odd neutron moving around the quadrupole excited $^{10}$Be core,  as  form factor} (Fig. \ref{fig6.3.1} (d)). 
  
  
  Insets 
  (A$_1$) and (A$_2$)  and diagrams (I) of Fig. \ref{fig6.2.3x} testify to the subtle effects resulting  from the unification of (NFT)$_{ren}$ of structure 
  and reactions, and operative in the cross sections   also shown in Fig. \ref{fig6.3.1}, as a result of the 
  simultaneous and self consistent treatment of correlations in configuration and 3D-space.  The bold face drawn state $\ket{(d_{5/2} \otimes 2^+)_{1/2^+}}$ shown in Fig. \ref{fig6.2.3x}(I)(a) 
  and the radial  wave function $(NFT)_{ren}$ displayed with a continuous curve in Fig. \ref{fig6.3.1} (d), can be viewed as {\it on par renormalized structure and reaction 
  intermediate (virtual) elements of the quantal process $^{11}$Be(p,d) $^{10}$Be($2^+$)}.
  



It is difficult, if not impossible, to talk about single-particle motion without also referring to collective vibrational states,  concerning both structure and reactions. Within this context, the difficulties of defining spectroscopic factors are apparent.

The consistency of the above picture was challenged by a $^9$Li$(d,p)^{10}$Li experiment\footnote{\label{f29C5} \cite{Cavallaro:17}.} which found no $\ell=0$ strength at low energies. In what follows an analysis of the corresponding results within the framework of continuum  (NFT)$_{\text{ren (s+r)}}$ is discussed.
\subsubsection{The $^9$Li$(d,p)^{10}$Li reaction}
The NFT structure calculations were carried out as already explained in connection with the single halo isotone $^{11}$Be$_7$. In fact, in the determination of the bare potential parameters also the normal Mayer-Jensen level sequence, $N=7$ isotones $^{12}_5$B and $^{13}_6$C, were included.

The self energy matrix $\sum_{\nu_1\nu_2}^{\mathbf{a}}(E)$ $(\mathbf{a}\equiv\{lj\})$ for the single-particle levels $\nu_1,\nu_2$ of $^{10}$Li fulfilling $50\text{ MeV}>\epsilon_{\nu_1},\epsilon_{\nu_2}>\epsilon_F$, was calculated in a spherical box of 60 fm (continuum discretization). The dressed single particle states were determined by diagonalizing $\sum_{\nu_1\nu_2}^{\mathbf a}(E)$. Up to about 2 MeV the spectrum is essentially determined by the $\widetilde {1/2}^+$ and $\widetilde {1/2}^-$ waves.

The $1/2^+$ scattering length was found to be\footnote{This value provides circumstantial evidence on how extended the system described by the virtual state $\ket{virt.}=\ket{\widetilde{1/2}^+ (\kappa=1/\alpha)}$ is. In particular, as compared to the closed shell $N=6$ core $^9$Li of radius $R_0(^9\text{Li})\approx2.6$ fm. A rough estimate of the overlap between $\ket{virt.}$ and single-particle states of $^9$Li can be attempted through the ratio $(R_0/|\alpha|)^3\approx3.4\times10^{-2}$. Within this scenario, one may better assess the importance  the many-body mixing amplitude $\braket{(d_{5/2}\otimes 2^+)_{1/2^+}|\widetilde{1/2}^+}\,\left(=\sqrt{0.02}\right)$ has in determine the properties of the renormalized $\ket{\widetilde{1/2}^+}$ state. Within this context see Eq. (\ref{eq6.2.1}).} $\alpha=-8$ fm, corresponding to an energy $\epsilon_{\widetilde{1/2}^+}=\hbar^2(1/\alpha)^2/2m\approx0.3$ MeV. The eigenfunction of a state lying close to this energy and, thus, representative of this virtual state is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq5.2.1}
\ket{\widetilde{1/2}^+}=\sqrt{0.98}\ket{s_{1/2}}+\sqrt{0.02}\ket{(d_{5/2}\otimes2^+)_{1/2^+}}. 
\end{equation}
\idx{Renormalized NFT!unbound nucleus: $^{10}$Li}
Similarly, the resonant $\widetilde{1/2}^-$  state can be  written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq5.2.2}
\ket{\widetilde{1/2}^-}=\sqrt{0.94}\ket{p_{1/2}}+\sqrt{0.07}\left|\left(\left(p_{1/2},p_{3/2}^{-1}\right)_{2^+}\otimes2^+\right)_{0^+}p_{1/2};1/2^-\right\rangle.
\end{equation}
The centroid and width of the resonance are $\epsilon_{\widetilde{1/2}^-}=0.5$ MeV, and $\Gamma_{\widetilde{1/2}^-}=0.35$ MeV respectively\footnote{For details see \cite{Barranco:20}, also supplemental material.}. Theory predicts also the existence of a $5/2^+$ resonance with a centroid at $\approx 3.5$ MeV. This state has also a clear many-body character, coupling to the quadrupole vibrations of the core through itself and through the $s_{1/2}$ state, not only in terms of virtual states containing one phonon ($\ket{(d_{5/2}\otimes2^+)_{5/2^+}}$, $\ket{(s_{1/2}\otimes2^+)_{5/2^+}}$)  but also many (non crossing) phonon states which can be summed to infinite order (rainbow series)\footnote{It is of notice that those many-phonon diagrams containing crossings are associated with vertex corrections. Because such diagrams imply recoupling coefficients of varied complexity and somewhat random phases, their summed contributions are expected to be considerably smaller than that of the rainbow series which displays coherence regarding the different contributions (see \cite{Barranco:19}).}. Anharmonicities associated with states of two or more quadrupole phonons, resulting essentially from Pauli principle violation (see inset (IV) Fig. \ref{fig6.3.1}), are found to play an important role. Larger in the present case than in the case of $^{11}$Be, in keeping with the fact that in $^{10}$Li the $\widetilde{5/2}^+$ resonance lies closer in energy to the $\widetilde{1/2}^+\otimes2^+$ state than in  $^{11}$Be. 


The coupling of the dressed neutron to the odd $1p_{3/2}^{-1}(\pi)$ proton hole leads to the doublets $(\widetilde{1/2}^+\otimes p_{3/2}^{-1}(\pi))_{1^-,2^-}$ and $(\widetilde{1/2}^-\otimes p_{3/2}^{-1}(\pi))_{1^+,2^+}$ and to the quadruplet $(\widetilde{5/2}^+\otimes p_{3/2}^{-1}(\pi))_{1^-,2^-,3^-,4^-}$. The scattering length of the resulting $2^-,1^-$ states lead to $\epsilon_{2^-}\approx0.05$ MeV and $\epsilon_{1^-}=0.8$ MeV. For the positive-parity doublet, one finds $\epsilon_{1^+}\approx0.3$ MeV and $\epsilon_{2^+}\approx0.6$ MeV, while the quadruplet spans the energy interval 2--6 MeV. Theory also predict a $3/2^-$ state which splits into four states $(\widetilde{3/2}^-\otimes p_{3/2}^{-1}(\pi))_{0^+,1^+,2^+,3^+}$ with energies within the range 3--6 MeV.


\idx{Renormalized NFT!unbound nucleus: $^{10}$Li}
Making use of the non-local self-energy matrices $\Sigma^a(r,r';E)$, whose configuration space representation correspond to $\Sigma^a_{\nu_1\nu_2}(E)$, together with global optical parameters\footnote{\cite{Schmitt:13}.} the absolute double differential cross sections $d\sigma/dEd\Omega$ containing  the information the $(d,p)$ reaction in question can provide on the structure of $^{10}$Li, was calculated.

 \textit{One can now put the following question:} recording the outgoing particle in the range of angles $5.5^\circ\leq\theta_{cm}\leq16.5^\circ$, what the probability   of observing the transferred neutron in the $\widetilde{1/2}^+$ final state is? The answer which arises from the strength function $\left.d\sigma_{\widetilde{1/2}^+}/dE\right)_{5.5^\circ-16.5^\circ}$ calculated by integrating $d\sigma/dEd\Omega$ in the chosen range of angles is univocal and reads \textit{negligible}, as it emerges from Fig. \ref{fig5.2.4}, where theory is confronted with the experimental data to satisfactory agreement.

\end{figure}

As seen from Fig. \ref{fig5.2.5} the situation changes radically if \textit{one puts the same question but changing the angular range from $5.5^\circ\leq\theta_{cm}\leq16.5^\circ$ into $50^\circ\leq\theta_{cm}\leq180^\circ$.} Equally univocally the answer now reads \textit{large}.

The reason at the basis of the essential difference between the two questions, and thus answers, is provided by the absolute differential cross section\footnote{The consistency with the $^9$Li$(d,p)^{10}$Li data of \cite{Jeppesen:06}, recorded in the angular range 98$^\circ\leq\theta_{cm}\leq134^\circ$ is apparent. For details see \cite{Barranco:20}. See also \cite{Moro:19}.} 
$d\sigma(\theta)_{\widetilde{1/2}^+}/d\Omega$ obtained integrating $d\sigma_{\widetilde{1/2}^+}/dEd\Omega$ over the energy interval 0--0.2 MeV. As observed from Fig. \ref{fig5.2.6} it results from a blend of structure, related to the single-particle content of the state (\ref{eq5.2.1}), and the interference pattern displayed by the outgoing distorted waves which shows a minimum close to $\theta_{cm}=16.5^\circ$.

\idx{Renormalized NFT!unbound nucleus: $^{10}$Li}
 Returning to Fig. \ref{fig5.2.4}, and still within the above scenario, one can posit that the overall agreement between theory and experiment observed for $\left.d\sigma/dE\right)_{5^\circ-16.5^\circ}$ within the energy range 3--4.5 MeV provides quantitative, although indirect, evidence of the presence
of a robust $1/2^+$ state at low energy. This is in keeping with the strong coupling found in the NFT results between the $s_{1/2}$ and $d_{5/2}$ virtual and resonant states respectively, through the quadrupole vibration of the core $^9$Li. In fact, due to this strong mixing either one reproduces both the $d\sigma_{\widetilde{1/2}^+}/dE$ and the $d\sigma_{\widetilde{5/2}^+}/dE$ strength functions or likely none of them\footnote{Within this context see \cite{Barranco:20}. See also \cite{Moro:19}.}.


 Because these couplings renormalize single-particle content, energies, and widths, as well as the radial dependence of the wavefunctions (form factors), all these elements have to be calculated self-consistently. The role played by such requirements is likely emphasized in the case like the present one, of continuous spectroscopy, in which structure and reaction are, in a very real sense, just two aspects of the same physics. 

\idx{Renormalized NFT!unbound nucleus: $^{10}$Li}
Before concluding the present section, it may be useful to remind us what, within the framework of quantum mechanics, one can learn from a reaction experiment. It is not ``what is the state after the collision'' but ``how probable is a given effect of the collision''\footnote{\cite{Born:26}.}.




If there is a lesson to be learned from the above discussion is the fact that, in dealing with a specific feature of a quantal many-body system, e.g. single-particle motion in nuclei (structure) and one-particle transfer process (reaction), one can hardly avoid to talk about other elementary modes of excitation and  reaction channels, respectively. Within the scenario of the chosen example, this is because a nucleon which, in first approximation is in a mean field stationary state, can actually be viewed as a fermion moving through a gas of  quadrupole phonons (ZPF) to which it couples, becoming eventually heavier because dressed by them  (case of $s_{1/2}$). But also due to Pauli principle, the nucleon  is forced to exchange role with the nucleons of the composite (particle-hole) phonons undergoing repulsion (case of $p_{1/2}$).
\section[Virtual states forced to become real]{Virtual states forced to become real through transfer reactions}\label{C6S4}
One of the main subjects which has been discussed in the present monograph concerns the melting of \textit{structure and reactions} and of \textit{bare, virtual and renormalized states} into a higher unity,  which can be described in terms of Feynman diagrams where particles come in and the same or other particles come out and  eventually interact with  detectors whose clicks can be translated into  absolute cross sections and lifetimes. Thus conveying to observations the properties of renormalized, dressed, physical elementary modes of excitation.




The initial and final asymptotic states of the (NFT)$_{\text{ren} (s+r)}$ Feynman diagrams are anchored to the laboratory (incoming beams and target-outgoing particles, including $\gamma$-rays and detectors). The intermediate states break  open (virtually) the incoming systems --e.g. a beam of the halo nucleus $^{11}$Li, of half life of 8.75 ms, which impinges on a hydrogen target (proton) in an inverse kinematic experiment as displayed in e.g. Fig. \ref{fig1.9.2} (a), in particular, within the time interval $t_1$--$t_{11}$-- to allow the elementary modes of excitation which are probed by the experiment to become active, interact (melt) with other modes, and eventually pass the information concerning the properties of the  physical modes to the outgoing particles.


Among these diagrams, one finds those associated with reaction processes in which a virtual state is acted upon and forced to become real, eventually reaching the detectors. A sort of Hawking radiation\footnote{\cite{Barranco:19b}.} to the extent that one concentrates on the (virtual)$\to$(real phenomenon) process, with the proviso of viewing the action of the external field as the (no-return) event horizon of the black hole.
An example of such diagrams which describes a possible event associated with the reaction $^1$H$(^{11}$Li,$^9$Li$(1/2^-))^3$H is displayed in Fig. \ref{fig1.9.3} (b): a virtual quadrupole vibration which, in the process of renormalizing the $s_{1/2}$ state, or of being exchanged between the partners of the neutron halo Cooper pair has been caught in the act by the pair transfer field produced by the ISAAC-2 facility at TRIUMF, and forced to become a real final state and to bring this information to the active detector MAYA (see also Fig. \ref{fig1.9.3} (d)).
\subsection[Empirical renormalization: (NFT)$_{\text{ren}}$(r+s) (Feynman + $S$-matrix)]{Empirical renormalization\footnote{See footnote \ref{f2C2} Ch. \ref{intro} }.} 
\idx{Renormalized NFT!empirical renormalization}
Most if not all theories able to provide a consistent description of structure and reactions of atomic nuclei can hardly avoid the separation between explicit and virtual configuration (phase) spaces\footnote{While configuration space traditionally refers to structure and phase space to reactions (see e.g. \cite{Feshbach:62}) these connotations tend to melt into a unity in the case of unstable, exotic nuclei like $^{11}$Li ($\tau_{1/2}\approx 8$ ms), let alone $^{10}$Li, transiently observed in terms of virtual and resonant states in a one-neutron transfer processes  (see  footnote \ref{f5.28} of the present Chapter; see also \cite{Barranco:20} and refs. therein). As a consequence, both structure and reactions are to be worked out in the continuum, discretization being a connotation of methodological, rather than of physical approach. Think only on the central role the tail of the neutron halo Cooper pair, bound by only 380 keV to the core ($^9$Li), play in stabilizing $^{11}$Li, and in connection with two-nucleon transfer process (formfactors). Within this scenario, inverse kinematics in e.g. the case of $^2$H($^9$Li,$^{10}$Li)$^1$H provides, in the laboratory set up, a large but finite box for both the probe (deuteron) and the probed ($^{10}$Li).}. Once this is recognized, a physical choice concerning the first type of degrees of freedom is: elementary modes of excitation. That is, the response of the nuclear system, to the variety of experimental probes.


But here empiricism ends\footnote{To the extent of attributing the ancient Greek meaning of ``find'' and ``discover'' to the word heuristic ($\epsilon\upsilon\rho i \sigma\kappa\omega$) and of ``serving to discover'' of the Oxford dictionary, one can connotate the above empirical protocol, as heuristic.}. Because the \textit{bare} elementary modes of excitation which potentially contains all of the physics that experiment can eventually provide, are not observables. To become so, they have to loose their elementarity and become mixed, dressed, renormalized, and melt together into effective fields. In fact, what we call a physical nucleon moving inside the nucleus is only partially to be associated with that nucleon field alone. It is also partially to be associated with the vibrational fields, because the two are in interaction . On the other hand, vibrational modes participating in virtual states which intervened upon with an appropriate external field can become on-shell, have to be dressed, fully renormalized modes, poised to be forced to become observable on short call\footnote{As a rule, the collective modes participating in these virtual state are calculated making use of empirical input. Thus, empirical renormalization.}.


As shown in Fig. \ref{fig6.6.2} (see also Fig. \ref{fig6.6.1}), the reaction $^{11}$Be$(p,d)^{10}$Be$(2^+)$ provides an embodiment of such processes.  	 In fact, this reaction gives information concerning the most important process   clothing   the $1/2^+$ parity inverted ground state of $^{11}_4$Be$_{7}$
through the coupling to the low-lying quadrupole vibration of the core $^{10}_4$Be$_6$ (see Fig. \ref{fig6.6.2} \textbf{I} (\textbf{a})). A schematic representation 
of the pickup of the neutron moving around a $N=6$ closed shell and populating the low-lying
quadrupole vibrational state of this core, in coincidence with the corresponding $\gamma$-decay is shown in \textbf{I}(\textbf{b}).  More  detailed structure and reaction NFT diagrams,  
are	shown in  \textbf{I}(\textbf{d}) and \textbf{I}(\textbf{e}), (the jagged line represents 
a graphic mnemonic of the recoil effect),  together with a cartoon representation in {\bf (f)}. The predicted (continuous curve) and experimental
(solid dots) absolute differential cross sections   are displayed in \textbf{I}(\textbf{c}).

Curved arrows indicate  motion in the continuum (reaction). Normal arrowed

At the basis of the  $\gamma$-decay displayed in \textbf{I}(\textbf{b}) and \textbf{I}(\textbf{e}) we find the processes shown in the lower part of Fig. \ref{fig6.6.2}, as it is explained in what follows. (\textbf{II}) Interaction of protons in a nucleus with nuclear vibrations (solid dot, PVC vertex

the vector potential, and $J_{\mu}$ the current density ($\mu=1,...,4)$).
While the variety of diagrams shown have general validity, we have assumed
we are dealing with the low-lying correlated particle-hole quadrupole vibration 
($L=2)$ of $^{10}_4$Be$_6$ lying at 3.368 MeV, the corresponding quadrupole transition probability $B(E2; 0^+ \to 2^+$) = 0.0052 $e^2 b^2$ being
associated with the dynamical deformation parameter $\beta_2 \approx 0.9$. An arrowed line pointing  upward (downward)

and subsequent $\gamma-$decay\footnote{It is of notice that this is not a bubble diagram in the sense of rule (III) of NFT, as the initial and final vertices are associated with different processes (nuclear, electromagnetic).}.


The above is an example of empirical renormalization (use of experimental elementary modes of excitation in both structure and  reaction channels or, as  in the present case, decay channels), namely  ((NFT)$_{\text{ren(s+r)}}$)\footnote{\cite{Broglia:16}.}.
\subsection{On-shell energy}
It was stated that intermediate states are, aside from their energy,  fully dressed, renormalized physically observable elementary modes of excitation. Concerning the eventual value of the on-shell-energy, it will naturally depend on the reaction process taking place.
For example, in the reaction $^{11}$Be$(p,d)^{10}$Be$(2^+$; 3.368 MeV) (Fig. \ref{fig6.6.2} \textbf{(I)} (b) and (e)) populating the quadrupole vibration of $^{10}$Be which, in the virtual $(\widetilde{5/2}^+\otimes 2^+)_{1/2^+}$ state dress the $\ket{\widetilde{1/2}^+}$ ground state of $^{11}$Be (Fig. \ref{fig6.6.2} \textbf{(I)} (a)), the on-shell-energy coincides with that which is observed in the inelastic process $^{10}$Be(gs$\to 2^+$). On the other hand, the $5/2^+$ pickup neutron, while displaying the structural properties of the $5/2^+$ resonance (Fig. \ref{fig6.6.1}) ($\tilde{\epsilon}_{{5/2}^+}=$ 1.45 MeV), it has a binding energy equal to $\tilde{\epsilon}_{{1/2}^+}-\hbar\omega_{2^+}=-3.868$ MeV $(\tilde{\epsilon}_{{1/2}^+}=-0.5\text{ MeV},\; \hbar\omega_{2^+}=3.368\text{ MeV})$, unrelated to the experimental energy of +1.28 MeV (continuum, unbound), recorded in the reaction $^{10}$Be$(d,p)^{11}$Be$(5/2^+)$. This is a natural outcome of (NFT)$_{\text{ren}}$ which, through the PVC and the Pauli mechanism, provides the proper clothing of the $d_{5/2}$ orbital so as to allow it to be able ``to exist'' inside the $\ket{\widetilde s_{1/2}}$ state as a virtual, intermediate configuration. The asymptotic $r$--behavior results from the coherent superposition of many continuum states.


We now consider the process in which an inelastic field acting on $\ket{^{11}\text{Be(gs)}}$ populates the $5/2^+$ resonance (see Fig. \ref{fig6.6.1}). An important contribution to this excitation results from the action of the external field on the quadrupole vibration of the virtual state $(\tilde d_{5/2}\otimes 2^+)_{1/2^+}$ which renormalizes the $1/2^+$ state (Fig. \ref{fig6.6.1} (a)) leading to diagram (b) of the same figure. In this case, the external field has to provide an energy equal to $|\tilde \epsilon_{1/2}-\tilde \epsilon_{5/2^+}|=$ 1.95 MeV, again unrelated to the on-shell energy of $\ket{^{10}\text{Be}(2^+; 3.868\text{ MeV})}$ observed in the inelastic process $^{10}$Be(gs$\to2^+$), but needed to dress the bare single-particle valence orbital.
\subsection{Perturbation and beyond}\label{S6.6}
In Q.E.D. at the one-loop diagrams level\footnote{Diagram not allowed by rule III) of NFT in keeping with the fact that the nuclear (quasi) bosons are (RPA) ``composite modes''.}, the renormalized physical electron mass $m_e$, \idx{Renormalized NFT!parallel with QED renormalization} that is the observed  mass ($\approx$ 0.511 MeV), is related to the  parameter $m$ in the Dirac equation, the bare electron mass (not observable), according to $m_e=m\left(1+\frac{3\alpha}{4\pi}\log\left(\frac{\Lambda_{cut}}{m}\right)^2\right)$, $\Lambda_{cut}$ being the cutoff of the divergent integrals\footnote{See \cite{Bjorken:98} pp 162--166; \cite{Milloni:94} p. 404.}. This quantity appears inside the log, and in front of it one has the fine structure constant $\alpha$ which is small $(\approx1/137)$. Therefore, even pushing the cutoff to the Planck scale, $\Lambda_{cut}\sim10^{19}$ GeV, with $m\sim$ MeV one has $\delta m_e/m\approx\frac{3\alpha}{4\pi}\log\left(\frac{\Lambda_{cut}}{m}\right)^2\approx 0.1.$ So $\delta m_e$ is really a small correction. 

One can compare the value of the four parameters (plus the effective mass functional) which determine the mean field (Saxon--Woods) potential used to calculate the bare single-particle energies of $^{11}$Be --imposing the condition that the dressed levels  best reproduce the experimental findings-- with the value of the corresponding parameters of the standard, global Woods--Saxon potential (and of effective mass equal to the observed mass $m$). The results displayed in Table \ref{tab6.6.1} testify to the fact that renormalization in nuclear physics, in particular in the case of halo, exotic parity inverted nuclei, is less ``perturbative'' than in the case of Q.E.D. This fact becomes even clearer if one compares the overall centroid of the valence orbitals as well as the density of levels associated with the two potentials.  

It is of notice that the Lamb (-like) shift taking place between the $s_{1/2}$ and $p_{1/2}$ valence levels of $^{11}$Be has a value of approximately 10\% ($(\Delta\epsilon_{1/2^+,1/2^-})_{bare}-(\Delta\epsilon_{1/2^+,1/2^-})_{ren}\approx3.11+0.32\text{MeV}$) of that of the Fermi energy ($\approx36$ MeV). This result can be compared with the ratio of the hydrogen $^2S_{1/2}-^2P_{1/2}$ Lamb shift (1058 MHz$\approx4.3\times10^{-9}$ eV) and the Rydberg constant ($R_H=$13.6 eV), i.e. $\approx10^{-10}$, a result which underscores the strong coupled situation one is confronted with in trying to describe the structure of light halo exotic nuclei (Fig. \ref{fig6.2.1x}).

\subsection{One-particle transfer (s+r)-dielectric function}
\idx{Vacuum polarization}
The fact that in spite of this non-perturbative situation, (NFT)$_{\text{ren (r+s)}}$ can provide an overall account of an essentially complete set of experimental data which characterizes $^{11}$Be, within a 10\% error, testifies to the power and flexibility Feynman version of Q.E.D. has. It can be used as paradigm to construct a field theory for both structure and reactions of a strongly interacting finite many--body system like the atomic nucleus. As already mentioned, examples of (NFT)$_{\text{ren (r+s)}}$ diagrams, aside from those discussed in detail in connection with Fig. \ref{fig6.6.2}, are displayed in Figs. \ref{fig1.9.3} and \ref{fig1.9.2}. The first describes the process  $^1$H$(^{11}$Li,$^9$Li$)^3$H providing a quantitative account of the data and  evidence of phonon induced pairing in nuclei. The second shows in (\textbf{a}), one of the most important channels contributing to the optical potential needed to describe the elastic scattering process $^1$H$(^{11}$Li,$^{11}$Li$)^1$H. It is of notice that in the case of $^9$Li$(d,p)^{10}$Li (self-energy) and reaction (optical potentials) dielectric functions melt together.
The calculation of the optical potential constitutes, within the scheme of (NFT)$_{\text{ren (r+s)}}$ a major challenge lying ahead.
\subsection{(NFT)$_{\text{ren(s+r)}}$ diagrams, $S$-matrix}\label{S6.6.2}
Landau felt that Feynman diagrams, although usually derived from conventional field theory have an independent basic importance\footnote{\cite{Landau:59}.} This work is closely connected with both Heisenberg statement that in quantum theory one should only introduce   quantities\footnote{\cite{Heisenberg:25}; see english translation W. Heisenberg, Quantum-theoretical re-interpretation of kinematical and mechanical relations, in \cite{VanderWaerden:67} p 261.} which are, in principle, observable and with the special role the scattering matrix plays in such a program. As the wavefunctions themselves cannot be observed and because the Hamiltonian formalism is intimately connected with wavefunctions, it may not be the most appropriate one to describe quantal systems. The quantities to be studied are the scattering amplitudes where particles go in and the same or different ones, including $\gamma$-rays, come out and  determine the cross sections of the different  processes.
Within this context we refer to diagrams (b) and (e) of Fig. \ref{fig6.6.2} (I) where the (NFT)$_{\text{ren (r+s)}}$  diagram describing the becoming of a concrete virtual process\footnote{Dressing of the $s_{1/2}$ ground state of $^{11}$Be, diagram (a), see also Table \ref{tab6.6.1} for the parameters of the bare potential.} real\footnote{Through the action of an external field namely $^{11}$Be$(p,d)^{10}$Be($2^+$).},  is displayed.

\section[Minimal mean field theory]{Minimal requirements for a consistent mean field theory}\label{C6AppA}
As seen from Figs. \ref{fig1.0.6}--\ref{fig1.0.8}  the minimum requirements of selfconsistency to be imposed upon single-particle motion requires both non-locality in space (HF) and in time (TDHF)
\begin{equation}\label{eq6.A.1}
i\hbar \frac{\partial \varphi_\nu}{\partial t}=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m}\nabla^2 \varphi_\nu(x,t)+\int dx'dt'U(x-x',t-t')\varphi_\nu(x',t').
\end{equation}
 Assuming, for simplicity, infinite nuclear matter (confined by a constant potential of depth $V_0$), and thus plane wave solutions, the above time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation leads to the quasiparticle dispersion relation 
\begin{equation}\label{eq6.A.2}
\hbar\omega=\frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m^*}+\frac{m}{m^*}V_0,
\end{equation}
where the effective mass
\begin{equation}\label{eq4.A.3}
m^*=\frac{m_k m_\omega}{m},\idx{Effective mass}
\end{equation}
is the product of the $k$-mass \idx{Effective mass!$k$-mass}
\begin{equation}
m_k=m\left(1+\frac{m}{\hbar^2k}\frac{\partial U}{\partial k}\right)^{-1},
\end{equation}
closely connected with the Pauli principle\footnote{Within this context see Sect. \ref{appintroD}, in particular footnote \ref{f46C2} of Ch. \ref{intro}.} $\frac{\partial U}{\partial k}\approx \frac{\partial U_x}{\partial k}$, while the $\omega$-mass \idx{Effective mass!$\omega$-mass}
\begin{equation}\label{eq6A5}
m_\omega=m\left(1-\frac{\partial U}{\partial \hbar \omega}\right),
\end{equation}
results from the dressing of the nucleon through the coupling with the (quasi) bosons. 


 The occupancy of levels around $\varepsilon_F$ is related to $Z_\omega$, a quantity which measures the discontinuity at the Fermi energy  and which is equal to $m/m_\omega$.  This is in keeping with the fact that the time the nucleon is coupled to the vibrations it cannot behave as a single-particle and can thus not contribute to e.g. the single-particle pickup cross section. \textit{The particle-vibration coupling not only renormalizes energies and single-particle content but also the radial dependence of the wavefunction (formfactors).}

















It is of notice that the self-consistence requirements for the iterative solution of Eq. (\ref{eq6.A.1}) reminds very much those associated with the solution of the Kohn-Sham equations in finite systems,
 \begin{equation}
 H^{KS}\varphi_\gamma(\mathbf{r})=\lambda_\gamma\varphi_\gamma(\mathbf{r}),
 \end{equation}
where
 \begin{equation}
 H^{KS}=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m_e}\nabla^2+U_H(\mathbf{r})+V_{ext}(\mathbf{r})+U_{xc}(\mathbf{r}),
 \end{equation}
$H^{KS}$ being known as the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian, $V_{ext}(\mathbf{r})$ being the field created by the ions and acting on the electrons. Both the Hartree and the exchange--correlation potentials $U_H(\mathbf{r})$ and $U_{xc}(\mathbf{r})$ depend on the (local) density, hence on the whole set of wavefunctions $\varphi_\gamma(\mathbf{r})$. Thus, the set of $KS$--equations must be solved selfconsistently\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Broglia:04b} and refs. therein.}.
\subsection{Density of levels}\label{C4AppA1}
Making use of Eq. (\ref{eq6.A.2})  ($E=\hbar\omega$), one can calculate $dE/dk$ for a single nucleon and one spin orientation\footnote{\cite{Mahaux:85}, p. 17.}. The inverse of this expression is
\begin{align}
\frac{dk}{dE}=\frac{m^*}{\hbar^2k},\idx{Density of levels}
\end{align} 
which testifies to the fact that the energy spacing between levels, i.e. the density of levels (see below), changes as $m^*$ does.

One can then calculate the average value over the Fermi distribution, obtaining
\begin{align}
\left\langle\frac{dk}{dE}\right\rangle=\frac{m^*}{\hbar^2(2/3)k_F}.
\end{align}
 Let us now take into account all nucleons, both spin orientations and eliminate the unit (inverse) length, i.e
\begin{align}
\frac{2A}{k_F}\left\langle\frac{dk}{dE}\right\rangle=3A\frac{m^*}{\hbar^2k_F^2}=3A\frac{m^*}{2m\epsilon_F}.
\end{align}
Assuming $m^*=m_\omega m_k/m\approx m$, where $m$ is the experimental nucleon mass one obtains
\begin{align}
\frac{3}{2}\frac{A}{\epsilon_F},
\end{align}
a value which coincides with the Fermi gas model estimate for the one--particle level density $g_0$\footnote{See e.g. \cite{Bohr:69} Eq. (2-48).}. Taking properly into account the geometry of the system, one obtains
\begin{align}\label{eq4A13}
a=\frac{\pi^2}{6}\frac{3}{2}\frac{A}{\epsilon_F}
\end{align}
for the prefactor of the exponential of the Fermi expression of the total density of single particle levels. Making use of $\epsilon_F=36$ MeV leads to,
\begin{align}\label{eq4A13x}
a\approx\frac{A}{14}\text{MeV}^{-1}.
\end{align}
In keeping with the fact that one can interpret $dE/dk$ as the rate of change in energy when the momentum changes or, equivalently, when the number of nodes per unit length changes, and this can be used to label the single-particle states, Eq. (\ref{eq4A13x}) can be confronted at profit with the average degeneracy per unit energy of valence orbitals (see Table \ref{tab4A1}). 



Within this context it is of notice that an estimate of the quantity $a$ based on the harmonic oscillator, leads to $a\approx\frac{\pi^2}{6}\frac{(N_{max}+3/2)^2}{\hbar\omega_0}$ i.e. an expression inversely proportional to the (constant) energy separation of levels \footnote{See \cite{Bohr:69} p. 188, Eq (2-125a).}. In an attempt to bridge the gap between the nuclear matter expressions discussed above and finite nuclei, i.e. potential wells of finite range, we consider
\begin{align}\label{eq4A14}
H=\frac{p^2}{2D}+\frac{C}{2}x^2,
\end{align}
$(p=D\dot x)$ which leads to a constant level spacing,
\begin{align}
\hbar\omega_0=\hbar\sqrt{\frac{C}{D}},
\end{align}
 and implies that the density of states is proportional to the square root of the particle inertia (mass). However, this result follows from the assumption that the potential remains unchanged if the bare mass (in which case $D$ is, for example, set equal to the HF $k$-mass, $m_k$) is replaced by an effective mass $m^*$ (e.g. $m_km_\omega/m$, Eq. (\ref{eq4.A.3})). However, the ground state wavefunction
 
\begin{align}\label{eq4A15}
\varphi_0\sim\exp\left(-\frac{x^2}{2b^2}\right),
\end{align}
with,
\begin{align}\label{eq4A16}
b=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{m^*\omega_0}},
\end{align}
will, in the case of a dressed nucleon of effective mass $m^*>D$,  shrink in space as compared with the one of mass $D$. Consequently, the mean square radius of the system
\begin{align}\label{eq4A17}
\left\langle r^2\right\rangle=\frac{\hbar}{m^*\omega_0}\left(N+\frac{3}{2}\right)=b^2\left(N+\frac{3}{2}\right)
\end{align}
will decrease. This is not correct, and one has to impose the condition $b^2$=constant. In other words, to use the relation (\ref{eq4A16}) with the condition $b=$const., \idx{Density of levels} to relate $\hbar\omega_0$ and $m^*$. A condition which implies that the energy difference between levels is inversely proportional to the effective mass of the nucleon\footnote{See Sect. \ref{S3.2}, Eq. (\ref{eq3.2.3}); also Fig. \ref{figintro6} ((a),(e)--(g)).}, that is,
\begin{align}\label{eq4A18x}
\hbar\omega_0=\frac{\hbar^2}{m^*b^2}.
\end{align}
Let us conclude this Section with a remark concerning the dimensions of the parameters $D$ and $C$ entering Eq. (\ref{eq4A14}). Because the variable $x$ has dimensions of length ($[x]$=fm), the dimensions of the inertia and restoring force parameters are

\begin{align*}
[C]=\text{MeV fm}^{-2}\quad\text{and}\quad [D]=\text{MeV fm}^{-2}\text{s}^2.
\end{align*}
Consequently the associated zero point fluctuations
\begin{align}\label{eq4A18}
\sqrt{\frac{\hbar\omega_0}{2C}}=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2D}\frac{1}{\hbar\omega_0}}
\end{align}
have dimensions of fm. It is of notice that in the case of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian (\ref{eq1.0.7}), the associated ZPF is a $c$-number, in keeping with the fact that the (dynamic) deformation parameter $\alpha$ is dimensionless and thus $[D]$=MeV$s^2$ and [$C$]=MeV.

In graphs (e) and (f) the amplitudes which eventually lead to the self-energy processes (b)--(d) are shown.}\label{fig6_D1}

These are triple-interaction  diagrams (phonon, particle and hole lines) in which none of the incoming lines can be detached from either of the other two by cutting one line. In connection with condensed matter Migdal's theorem  (\cite{Migdal:58}) states that for phonons, (\cite{Bardeen:55},  \cite{Frohlich:52}) vertex corrections can be neglected (cf. also \cite{Anderson:64}). Vertex corrections are, as a rule, important in the nuclear case where they lead to conspicuous cancellations of the self-energy contributions (d) and (e) (cf. e.g. \cite{Bortignon:83}, cf. also \cite{Anderson:64}). The solid grey circle in (c) represents the effective, renormalized vertex. In graphs (f) and (g) the amplitudes describing the coupling of a $p-h$ vibrational mode with the $2p-2h$ doorway states which eventually lead to  vertex  and self energy corrections  ((a)--(e)) are schematically displayed.}\label{fig6_D2}
\end{figure}
In Fig. \ref{fig6_D1} a graphical example is displayed of the fact that in QED (and thus in NFT tailored after it) nothing is really free and that e.g., the bare mass of a fermion (electron or nucleon), is the parameter one adjusts so that the renormalized particle (graphs (b)--(d)) displays properties which agree with experimental findings.In this case, the observed mass $m_e$ (single-particle energy $\epsilon_\nu$). 


In Fig. \ref{fig6_D2}, lowest order diagrams associated with the renormalization of the fermion-boson interaction (vertex corrections) are shown. The sum of contributions (a) and (b) can, in principle, be represented by a renormalized vertex (see diagram (c)). There is, as a rule, conspicuous interference (e.g. cancellation) in the nuclear case between vertex and self-energy contributions (see diagrams (a)+(b) and (d)+(e) of Fig. \ref{fig6_D2}, a phenomenon closely related with conservation laws\footnote{ \cite{Schrieffer:64}); \cite{Bortignon:81,Bertsch:83} and \cite{Bortignon:98} pp. 82--86.}. In particular, cancellation in the case in which the bosonic modes are of isoscalar, spin-independent character\footnote{\cite{Bortignon:83}.}. \textit{Consequently, one has to sum explicitly the resulting amplitudes, with the corresponding phases and eventually take the modulus squared,  to eventually obtain the quantities to be compared with the data, a fact that call attention to the use of an effective, $\omega$-independent (renormalized) vertex (Fig. \ref{fig6_D2} (c))}.

Within the framework of QED the above mentioned cancellations are exact implying, for example, that the interaction between one- and two-photon states vanishes (Furry theorem). The physics at the basis of the cancellation found in the nuclear case can be exemplified by looking at a spherical, closed shell nucleus displaying a low-lying collective octupole vibration, like e.g. in $^{208}$Pb where $\ket{3^-;2.615\text{ MeV}}$ is the first excited state, its $B(E3)$ being equal to 32 $B_{sp}$. The associated zero point fluctuations (ZPF) lead to time dependent shapes with varied instantaneous values of the octupole moment. In other words, an important component of the ZPF associated with $\ket{gs(^{208}\text{Pb})}$ (vacuum) state can be written as ($|(j_p \otimes j_h^{-1})_{3^-} \otimes 3^-; 0^+\rangle $). It can be viewed as a  gas of octupole (quasi) bosons promoting a nucleon across the Fermi surface (particle-hole excitation), leading to fermionic states which behave as having a positive (particle) and a negative (hole) effective octupole moment. This is in keeping with the fact that the closed shell system is spherical, and thus has zero octupole moment.
\subsection{Phase coherence and damping of vibrational modes}\label{S5.5.1} 
Paradigmatic examples of vibrational modes are provided by giant resonances. In particular by the giant dipole resonance (GDR). This collective mode is made out of correlated particle-hole excitations. An estimate of the associated damping width can be obtained in terms of the sum of the individual widths of the particle and of the hole. With he help of  relations (\ref{eqn:47}), (\ref{eqn:48}) valid for both particles and holes, one obtains
\begin{align}\label{eq5.5.1}
\Gamma_{GDR}(\hbar\omega_{GDR})=\Gamma_p(\hbar\omega_{GDR}/2)+\Gamma_h(\hbar\omega_{GDR}/2)\approx0.5\,\hbar\omega_{GDR},
\end{align}
where the assumption was made that the excitation energy $\hbar\omega_{GDR}$ is divided equally between the particle and the hole. Making use of the empirical expression $\hbar\omega_{GDR}\approx80/A^{1/2}$ MeV (Eq. (\ref{eq0.1.107}) and following text), one can write
\begin{align}\label{eq5.5.2}
\Gamma_{GDR}\approx\frac{40}{A^{1/3}}\text{ MeV},
\end{align}
which, in the case of $^{208}$Pb leads to $\Gamma_{GDR}\approx7$ MeV. A number to be compared with the experimental value\footnote{\cite{Bertrand:81}.} of $\approx4$ MeV. This overprediction of a factor of 2, is a consequence of taking the modulus squared of the amplitudes associated with graphs (e) and (f) of Fig. \ref{fig6_D1} separately, instead of doing so after having summed them with the proper phase (see Fig. \ref{fig6_D2} (f), (g)). That is
\begin{align}\label{eq5.5.3}
\Gamma_{GDR}\approx\left|\frac{\sqrt{\Gamma_p}+e^{-i\alpha}\sqrt{\Gamma_h}}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2\approx\Gamma_p\left|\frac{1+e^{-i\alpha}}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2=\Gamma_p\left(1+\cos2\alpha\right),
\end{align}
where 
\begin{align}\label{eq5.5.4}
\alpha=(1-c)\,\pi/2,
\end{align}
$c$ being defined by the relation $(\tau \hat F\tau^{-1})^\dagger=-c\hat F$, where $c(=\pm1)$ is a c-number, $\hat F$ is the single-particle operator entering in the particle-vibration coupling Hamiltonian (see Eqs. (\ref{eq1.0.14})--(\ref{eq1.0.15})). In the case in which the (quasi-) bosonic mode is a low-lying surface vibration (see Eq. (\ref{eq1.0.16}))\footnote{The precise formulation of this result is that in the case in which the field $\hat F$ is spin- and isospin-independent, $c=-1$ (see \cite{Bortignon:83}, see also \cite{Bortignon:81}).}, $c=-1$. As a result, a conspicuous cancellation between the particle- and hole-contributions\footnote{The fact that expression (\ref{eq5.5.3}) leads to complete cancellation is in keeping with the approximation that the single-particle and -hole subspaces are identical (i.e. $\Gamma_p=\Gamma_h$). In fact, the finite value of $\Gamma_{GR}$ in general and of $\Gamma_{GDR}$ in particular, is associated with the asymmetry existing between particle- and hole- subspaces.} takes place (see diagrams (a) and (b) of Fig. \ref{fig5.5.3}), where typical amplitudes contributing to the damping width $\Gamma_{GDR}$ of $^{208}$Pb are displayed). 


It is of notice that for giant pairing vibrations,  built out of two correlated particles (or holes), the corresponding contributions (see diagrams (c) and (d), Fig. \ref{fig5.5.3}) have the same sign, the expression $\Gamma_{GPV}\approx0.5\,\hbar\omega_{GPV}$ (see also (\ref{eq5.5.1})) being, in this case, the correct one.

\section{Single-nucleon transfer for pedestrians}\label{C6AppE}

In what follows we discuss some aspects of the relations existing between nuclear structure and one-particle transfer cross sections. To do so, we repeat some of the steps carried out in Sect. \ref{C4S1}, but this time in a simpler way, essentially ignoring the implications associated with the spin carried out by the particles, the spin-orbit dependence of the optical model potential, the recoil effect, etc.

We consider the case of $A(d,p)A+1$ reaction, namely that of neutron stripping. The intrinsic wave functions $\psi_\alpha$ and $\psi_\beta$, where $\alpha=(A,d)$ and $\beta=((A+1),p)$,
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}\label{eqC6E1}
&\psi_\alpha=\psi_{M_{A}}^{I_A}(\xi_A) \phi_d(\mathbf r_{np}),\\
\begin{split}\label{eqC6E1b}
&\psi_\beta=\psi_{M_{A+1}}^{I_{A+1}}(\xi_{A+1})\\
& \;\;\;\;=\sum_{l,I'_A} (I'_A;l \vert \} I_{A+1})
[\psi^{I'_A}(\xi_A)\phi^l(\vec r_{n})]_{M_{A+1}-M_A}^{I_{A+1}},
\end{split}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $(I'_A;l \vert \} I_{A+1})$ is a generalized fractional parentage coefficient. It is of notice that, as a rule,  \mbox{$(I'_A;l \vert \} I_{A+1})\,\phi^l(\vec r_{n})$} should be able to describe a dressed quasiparticle state containing only a fraction of the  single particle strength. Although ignoring possible radial renormalization we assume, for simplicity, the expansion to be operative.	
To further simplify the derivation we assume we are dealing with spinless particles. This is the reason why no ``intrinsic'' proton wavefunction appears in Eq. (\ref{eqC6E1b}). The variable $\vec r_{np}$ is the relative coordinate of the proton and the neutron (see Fig. \ref{fig6_E1}).


The transition matrix element can now be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq423}
 \begin{split}
T_{d,p}&= \langle \psi_{M_{A+1}}^{I_{A+1}}(\xi_{A+1}) \chi^{(-)}_p(\mathbf k_p,\mathbf r_p),
V'_\beta \, \psi_{M_{A}}^{I_{A}}(\xi_{A}) \chi^{(+)}_d(\mathbf k_d,\mathbf r_d)\rangle \\
&= \sum_{\substack{l,I'_A\\M'_A}} (I'_A;l \vert \} I_{A+1}) (I'_A \,M'_A\, l\, M_{A+1}-M'_A \vert I_{A+1}\,M_{A+1})\\
& \times\int d\mathbf r_n d \mathbf r_p \chi^{* (-)}_p(\mathbf k_p,\mathbf r_p) \phi_{M_{A+1}-M'_A}^{*l}(\mathbf r_n)
(\psi_{M_{A}}^{I_{A}}(\xi_{A}),V'_\beta \psi_{M'_{A}}^{I'_{A}}(\xi_{A}))\\
& \times\phi_d(\mathbf r_{np})
\chi^{(+)}_d(\mathbf k_d,\mathbf r_d) \; \delta_{I'_A,I_A} \; \delta_{M'_A,M_A}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
In the stripping approximation
\begin{equation}\label{eq424}
 \begin{split}
V'_\beta & = V_\beta(\xi,\mathbf r_\beta)- \bar U_\beta (r_\beta)\\
&=V_\beta(\xi_A,\mathbf r_{pA})+V_\beta(\mathbf r_{pn})-\bar U_\beta (r_{pA}).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Then
\begin{equation}\label{eq425}
 \begin{split}
(\psi_{M_{A}}^{I_{A}}(\xi_{A}) & ,V'_\beta \psi_{M_{A}}^{I_{A}}(\xi_{A}))=
(\psi_{M_{A}}^{I_{A}}(\xi_{A}), V_\beta(\xi_A,\mathbf r_{pA}) \psi_{M_{A}}^{I_{A}}(\xi_{A}))\\
&+(\psi_{M_{A}}^{I_{A}}(\xi_{A}), V_\beta(\mathbf r_{pn})
\psi_{M_{A}}^{I_{A}}(\xi_{A}))- \bar U_\beta (r_{pA}).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We assume
\begin{equation}\label{eq426}
  U_\beta (r_{pA})=(\psi_{M_{A}}^{I_{A}}(\xi_{A}), V_\beta(\xi_A,\mathbf r_{pA}) \psi_{M_{A}}^{I_{A}}(\xi_{A})).
\end{equation}
Then
\begin{equation}\label{eq427}
(\psi_{M_{A}}^{I_{A}}(\xi_{A}), V'_\beta\, \psi_{M_{A}}^{I_{A}}(\xi_{A}))= V_{np}(\mathbf r_{pn}).
\end{equation}

\caption{Coordinates used in the description of the $A (d,p)(A+1)$ stripping process.}\label{fig6_E1}
\end{figure}

Inserting eq. (\ref{eq427}) into eq. (\ref{eq423}) we obtain
 \begin{equation}\label{eq428}
 \begin{split}
T_{d,p}&= \sum_l (I_A;l \vert \} I_{A+1}) (I_A\, M_A\, l\, M_{A+1}-M_A \vert I_{A+1}\,M_{A+1})  \\
&\times\int d\mathbf r_n d \mathbf r_p \chi^{* (-)}_p(\mathbf k_p,\mathbf r_p) \phi_{M_{A+1}-M_A}^{*l}(\mathbf r_n)
V(\mathbf r_{pn}) \phi_d(\mathbf r_{np})
\chi^{(+)}_d(\mathbf k_d,\mathbf r_d).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The differential cross section is then equal to
\begin{equation}\label{eq429}
\frac{d \sigma}{d \Omega} = \frac{2}{3} \frac{\mu_p \mu_d}{(2\pi \hbar^2)^2}\frac{(2I_{A+1}+1)}{(2I_A+1)}
\frac{k_p}{k_d}\sum_{l,m_l}\frac{(I_A;l \vert \} I_{A+1})^2}{2l+1} \vert B_{m_l}^l\vert ^2,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{eq430}
B_{m_l}^l(\theta)=\int d\mathbf r_n d \mathbf r_p \chi^{* (-)}_p(\mathbf k_p,\mathbf r_p) Y_m^{*l}(\hat {\mathbf r}_n) u_{nl}(r_n)
V(\mathbf r_{pn}) \phi_d(\mathbf r_{np})
\chi^{(+)}_d(\mathbf k_d,\mathbf r_d)
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6E10}
\phi_m^{l}(\mathbf r_n)=u_{nl}(r_n) Y_m^{l}(\hat {\mathbf r}_n),
\end{equation}
is the single-particle wave function of a neutron bound to  the core A. For simplicity, the radial wave function $u_{nl}(r_n)$ can be assumed to be a solution of a Saxon-Woods potential of parameters $V_0\approx 50$ MeV, $a=0.65$ fm and $r_0=1.25$ fm.



The relation (\ref{eq429}) gives the cross section for the stripping from the projectile of a neutron that would correspond to the n$^{\mathrm{th}}$ valence neutron in the nucleus ($A+1$). If we now want the cross section for stripping any of the valence nutrons of the final nucleus from the projectile, we must multiply eq. (\ref{eq429}) by $n$. A more careful treatment of the antisymmetry with respect to the neutrons shows this to be the correct answer.


Finally we get
\begin{equation}\label{eq432}
\frac{d \sigma}{d \Omega}=\frac{(2I_{A+1}+1)}{(2I_A+1)} \sum_l S_l \sigma_l(\theta),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{eq433}
S_l= n (I_A;l \vert \} I_{A+1})^2,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eq434}
\sigma_l(\theta)=\frac{2}{3} \frac{\mu_p \mu_d}{(2\pi \hbar^2)^2}
\frac{k_p}{k_d}\frac{1}{2l+1}\sum_{m} \vert B_{m}^l\vert^2
\end{equation}


Distorted wave codes evaluate numerically  the quantity $B_{m_l}^l(\theta)$, using for the wave functions $\chi^{(-)}$ and $\chi^{(+)}$ the solution of the optical potentials that fit the elastic scattering, i.e.
\begin{equation}\label{eq435}
(-\nabla ^2+\bar U-k^2) \chi=0,
\end{equation}
Note that if the target nucleus is even-even, $I_A=0$,  $l=I_{A+1}$. That is, only one $l$ value contributes in Eq. (\ref{eq429}), and the angular distribution is uniquely given by $\sum_{m} \vert B_{m}^l\vert^2$. The $l$-dependence of the angular distributions helps to identify $I_{A+1}$. The factor $S_l$ needed to normalize the calculated function to the data yields (assuming a good fit to the angular distribution), is known in the literature as the spectroscopic factor. In the early stages of studies of nuclear structure with one-particle transfer reactions it was assumed, not only that such quantity could be accurately defined, but also that it contained all the nuclear structure information (aside from that associated with the angular distribution) which could be extracted from single-particle transfer. In other words, that it was the bridge directly connecting theory with experiment. \emph{Because nucleons are never bare, but are dressed by the coupling to collective modes, coupling which renormalizes not only the single-particle content but also the single-particle wavefunctions (formfactors),   the spectroscopic factor approximation is not straightforward to justify.}



There is a fundamental problem which makes the handling of integrals like that of (\ref{eq430}) difficult to handle from a structure point of view, if not numerically at least conceptually. This difficulty is connected with the so called recoil effect \footnote{While this effect could be treated in a cavalier fashion in the case of light ion reactions ($m_a/m_A\ll 1$), this was not possible in the case of heavy ion reactions, as the change in momenta involved was always sizeable (cf. \citet{Broglia:04a} and refs. therein).}, namely the fact that the center of mass of the two interacting particles in entrance ($\mathbf r_{\alpha}: \alpha=a+A$) and exit  ($\mathbf r_{\beta}: \beta=b+B$) channels is different. This is at variance with what one is accustomed to deal with in nuclear structure calculations, in which the Hartree potential depends on a single coordinate, as well as in the case of elastic and inelastic reactions, situations in which $\mathbf r_{\alpha}=\mathbf r_{\beta}$. When $\mathbf r_{\alpha}\neq\mathbf r_{\beta}$ we enter a rather more complex many-body problem, in particular if continuum states are to be considered, than nuclear structure practitioners are accustomed to.
 
 

 
 
 Returning to the subject of the present Section, it is in general useful to be able to introduce approximations which can help the physics which is at the basis of the phenomenon under discussion (single-particle motion), to emerge in a natural way, if not to compare in detail with the experimental data. 
Within this context, to reduce the integral (\ref{eq430}) one can assume that the proton-neutron interaction $V_{np}$ has zero-range, i.e.
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppE15}
 V_{np}(\mathbf r_{np})\phi_d(\mathbf r_{np})=D_0 \delta(\mathbf r_{np})
\end{equation}
so that  $B_{m}^l$ becomes equal to
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6E16}
B_{m_l}^l(\theta)=D_0 \int d\mathbf r\, \chi^{* (-)}_p(\mathbf k_p,\mathbf r) Y_{m_l}^{*l}(\hat {\mathbf r}) u_{l}(r)
\chi^{(+)}_d(\mathbf k_d,\mathbf r),
\end{equation}
which is  a three dimensional integral, but in fact essentially a one--dimensional integral, as the integration over the angles can be worked out analytically.


\subsection{Plane-wave limit}


If in Eq. (\ref{eq435}) one sets $\bar U=0$, the distorted waves become plane waves i.e.
 \begin{subequations}
\begin{align}\label{eq437}
&\chi^{(+)}_d(\mathbf k_d,\mathbf r)=e^{i \mathbf k_d \cdot \mathbf r},\\
&\chi^{*(-)}_d(\mathbf k_p,\mathbf r)=e^{-i \mathbf k_p \cdot \mathbf r}.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Equation (\ref{eqC6E16}) can now be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq438}
B_{m}^l=D_0 \int d\mathbf r e^{i (\mathbf k_d-\mathbf k_p) \cdot \mathbf r} Y_m^{*l}(\hat{\mathbf r}) u_{l}(r).
\end{equation}
The linear momentum transferred to the nucleus is $\mathbf k_d-\mathbf r_p=\mathbf q$.
Let us expand $e^{i \mathbf q \cdot \mathbf r}$ in spherical harmonics, i.e.
\begin{equation}\label{eq439}
\begin{split}
 e^{i \mathbf  q \cdot \mathbf r}&=\sum_l i^l j_l(qr)(2l+1)P_l(\hat {\mathbf q} \cdot \hat {\mathbf r})\\
& =4 \pi \sum_l i^l j_l(qr)\sum_m Y_m^{*l}(\hat {\mathbf q}) Y_m^{l}(\hat {\mathbf r}),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
so
\begin{equation}\label{eq440}
 \int d\hat {\mathbf r} e^{i \mathbf  q \cdot \mathbf r} Y_m^{l}(\hat {\mathbf r})= 4 \pi i^l j_l(qr) Y_m^{*l}(\hat {\mathbf q}).
\end{equation}
Then
\begin{equation}\label{eq441}
\begin{split}
 \sum_{m} \vert B_{m}^l\vert^2 & = \sum_{m} \vert Y_m^{l}(\hat {\mathbf q})\vert^2 D_0^2 16 \pi^2  \\
& \times\left \vert \int r^2 dr j_l(qr) u_l(r) \right \vert ^2\\
& =\frac{2l+1}{4 \pi} D_0^2 16 \pi^2 \left \vert \int r^2 dr j_l(qr) u_l(r) \right \vert ^2.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Thus, the angular distribution is given by the integral $\left \vert \int r^2 dr j_l(qr) u_l(r) \right \vert ^2$. If one assumes that the process takes place mostly on the surface, the angular distribution will be given by $ \vert j_l(qR_0) \vert ^2$, where $R_0$ is the nuclear radius.

\end{figure}

We then have
\begin{equation}\label{eq442}
 \begin{split}
  q^2&= k_d^2+k_p^2- 2 k_d k_p \cos(\theta)\\
& =(k_d^2+k_p^2- 2 k_d k_p) + 2 k_d k_p (1-\cos(\theta))\\
& =(k_d-k_p)^2+ 4 k_d k_p \left(\sin (\theta/2)\right) ^2  \\
& \approx 4 k_d k_p \left(\sin (\theta/2)\right) ^2,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
since $ k_d \approx k_p $ for stripping reactions at typical bombarding energies. Thus the angular distribution has a diffraction-like structure given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq443}
\vert j_l(qR_0) \vert ^2= j_l^2 (2R_0 \sqrt{k_d k_p} \sin (\theta/2)).
\end{equation}
The function $j_l(x)$ has its first maximum at $x=l$, i.e. where
\begin{equation}\label{eq444}
\sin (\theta/2)=\frac{l}{2 R_0 k},\quad \quad (k_p \approx  k_d=k),
\end{equation}
Examples of the above relation are provided in Fig. \ref{fig3}.

\section{One-particle knockout within DWBA}\label{C6AppF}
\idx{Knock-out reactions}
\subsection{Spinless particles}
We  consider the reaction $A+a \rightarrow a+b+c$, in which particle $b$ (group of particles, cluster) is knocked out from the nucleus $A(=c+b)$. Cluster $b$ is thus initially bound, while the final states of $a,b$ and the initial state of $a$ are all in the continuum, and can be described with distorted waves defined as scattering solutions of an optical potential. A schematic depiction of the situation is shown in Fig. \ref{figC6F1}. While the derivation presented below is quite general, special emphasis is set to one--particle knock--out processes. 
\subsubsection{Transition amplitude}
A first derivation will be given in which, for simplicity, all the ``particles'' (nuclei) involved in the reaction process are spinless and inert. Use is made of central, complex optical potentials ($U(r_{aA}),U(r_{cb}),U(r_{ac})$)  without a spin-orbit term. In addition, the interaction $v(r_{ab})$ between $a$ and $b$ is taken to be a function of the distance $r_{ab}$. Within this scenario, the transition amplitude which is at the basis of the evaluation of the multi--differential cross section is the 6-dimensional integral
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppF1}
\begin{split}
T_{m_b}=\int d\mathbf{r}_{aA}d \mathbf{r}_{bc}\chi^{(-)*}(\mathbf{r}_{ac})\chi^{(-)*}(\mathbf{r}_{bc})v(r_{ab})\chi^{(+)}(\mathbf{r}_{aA})u_{l_b}(r_{bc})Y^{l_b}_{m_b}(\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{bc}).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Coordinates}
The vectors $\mathbf{r}_{ab},\mathbf{r}_{ac}$ can easily be written in function of the integration variables $\mathbf{r}_{aA},\mathbf{r}_{bc}$ (see Fig. \ref{figC6F1}), namely
\begin{equation}\label{eq6G2}
\begin{split}
\mathbf{r}_{ac}&=\mathbf{r}_{aA}+\frac{b}{A}\mathbf{r}_{bc},\\
\mathbf{r}_{ab}&=\mathbf{r}_{aA}-\frac{c}{A}\mathbf{r}_{bc},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $b,c,A$ stand for the number of nucleons of the species $b,c$ and $A$ respectively.
\subsubsection{Distorted waves in the continuum}
A standard way to reduce the dimensionality of the integral (\ref{eqC6AppF1}) consists in expanding the continuum wave functions $\chi^{(+)}(\mathbf{r}_{aA}),\chi^{(-)*}(\mathbf{r}_{ac}),\chi^{(-)*}(\mathbf{r}_{bc})$ in a basis of eigenstates of the angular momentum operator (partial waves). Then one can exploit the transformation properties of these eigenstates under rotations to conveniently carry out the angular integrations. Making use of time--reversed phasing, that is
\begin{equation}\label{eq6G3}
Y_m^l(\theta,\phi)=i^l \sqrt{\frac{2l+1}{4\pi}\frac{(l-m)!}{(l+m)!}}P_l^m(\cos \theta)e^{im\phi},
\end{equation}
 the general form of these expansions is
 \begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppF2}
\chi^{(+)}(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{r})= \sum_{l}\frac{4\pi}{k r} i^{l}\sqrt{2l+1}
e^{i\sigma^{l}} F_{l}(r) \left[ Y^{l} (\hat {\mathbf{r}}) Y^{l} (\hat {\mathbf{k}})\right]^0_0,
\end{equation}
and
 \begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppF3}
\chi^{(-)*}(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{r})= \sum_{l}\frac{4\pi}{k r} i^{-l}\sqrt{2l+1}
e^{i\sigma^{l}} F_{l}(r) \left[ Y^{l} (\hat {\mathbf{r}}) Y^{l} (\hat {\mathbf{k}})\right]^0_0,
\end{equation}
$\sigma_l$ being the Coulomb phase shift. The radial functions $F_{l}(r)$ are regular (finite at $r=0$) solutions of the one--dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equation with an effective potential $U(r)+\tfrac{\hbar^2 l(l+1)}{2\mu r^2}$ and suitable asymptotic behaviour at $r\rightarrow\infty$ as boundary conditions. 
Thus, the distorted waves appearing in (\ref{eqC6AppF1}) are,
 \begin{equation}\label{eq4}
\chi^{(+)}(\mathbf{k_{a}},\mathbf{r}_{aA})= \sum_{l_a}\frac{4\pi}{k_a r_{aA}} i^{l_a}\sqrt{2l_a+1}
e^{i\sigma^{l_a}} F_{l_a}(r_{aA}) \left[ Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{aA}) Y^{l_a} (\hat{ \mathbf k}_{a})\right]^0_0,
\end{equation}
describing the relative motion of $A$ and $a$ in the entrance channel as determined by  the complex optical potential $U(r_{Aa})$,
 \begin{figure}

\vspace{-4cm}
\caption{System of coordinates used to describe the reaction $A+a \rightarrow a+b+c$. The nucleus $A$ is viewed as an inert cluster $b$ bounded to an inert core $c$.}\label{figC6F1}
\end{figure}
 \begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppF7}
\chi^{(-)*}(\mathbf{k'_{a}},\mathbf{r}_{ac})= \sum_{l'_a}\frac{4\pi}{k'_a r_{ac}} i^{-l'_a}\sqrt{2l'_a+1}
e^{i\sigma^{l'_a}} F_{l'_a}(r_{ac}) \left[ Y^{l'_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{ac}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{a})\right]^0_0,
\end{equation}
which describes the  relative motion of $c$ and $a$, in the final channel controlled by the complex optical potential $U(r_{ac})$, and finally
 \begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppF8}
\chi^{(-)*}(\mathbf{k'_{b}},\mathbf{r}_{bc})= \sum_{l'_b}\frac{4\pi}{k'_b r_{bc}} i^{-l'_b}\sqrt{2l'_b+1}
e^{i\sigma^{l'_b}} F_{l'_b}(r_{bc}) \left[ Y^{l'_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc}) Y^{l'_b} (\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{b})\right]^0_0,
\end{equation}
final channel  wavefunction describing the relative motion of $b$ and $c$, as defined by the complex optical potential $U(r_{bc})$).
\subsubsection{Recoupling of angular momenta}
One now proceeds to the evaluation of the 6--dimensional integral
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppF14}
\begin{split}
\frac{64\pi^3}{k_ak'_ak'_b}&\int d\mathbf{r}_{aA}d \mathbf{r}_{bc}u_{l_b}(r_{cb})v(r_{ab})\sum_{l_a,l'_a,l'_b}\sqrt{(2l_a+1)(2l'_a+1)(2l'_b+1)}\\
&\times e^{i(\sigma^{l_a}+\sigma^{l'_a}+\sigma^{l'_b})} \frac{F_{l_a}(r_{aA})  F_{l'_a}(r_{ac})F_{l'_b}(r_{bc})}{r_{ac}r_{aA}r_{bc}}\\
&\times \left[ Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{aA}) Y^{l_a} (\hat{ \mathbf k}_{a})\right]^0_0\left[ Y^{l'_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{ac}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{a})\right]^0_0\left[ Y^{l'_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc}) Y^{l'_b} (\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{b})\right]^0_0Y^{l_b}_{m_b}(\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{bc}),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
an  expression which explicitly depends  on the asymptotic kinetic energies  and scattering angles  ($\hat{ \mathbf k}_{a},\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{a},\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{b}$) of $a,b$ as determined by $k_a,k'_a,k'_b$ and $\hat{ \mathbf k}_{a},\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{a},\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{b}$ respectively.
In what follows we will take advantage of the partial wave expansion to reduce the dimensionality of the integral from 6 to 3. A possible strategy to follow is that of recoupling together all the terms that depend on the integration variables to a global angular momentum and retain  only the term coupled to 0 as the only one surviving the integration.
Let us start to separately couple  the terms corresponding to particles $a$ and  $b$. For particle $a$ we write
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG10}
\begin{split}
\left[ Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{aA}) Y^{l_a} (\hat{ \mathbf k}_{a})\right]^0_0 & \left[ Y^{l'_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{ac}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{a})\right]^0_0=\sum_K \bigl((l_a l_a)_0(l'_a l'_a)_0|(l_a l'_a)_K(l_a l'_a)_K\bigr)_0\\
& \times \left\{\left[ Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{aA}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf r}_{ac})\right]^K \left[Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf k}_{a}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{a})\right]^K\right\}^0_0.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can now evaluate the $9j$--symbol,
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG11}
\bigl((l_a l_a)_0(l'_a l'_a)_0|(l_a l'_a)_K(l_a l'_a)_K\bigr)_0=\sqrt{\frac{2K+1}{(2l'_a+1)(2l_a+1)}},
\end{equation}
and expand the coupling,
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG12}
\begin{split}
&\left\{\left[ Y^{l_a}(\hat{\mathbf r}_{aA})  Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf r}_{ac})\right]^K \left[Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf k}_{a}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{a})\right]^K\right\}^0_0=\sum_M \langle K\;K\;M\;-M|0\;0\rangle\\
&\times \left[ Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{aA}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf r}_{ac})\right]^K_M \left[Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf k}_{a}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{a})\right]^K_{-M}=\sum_M\frac{(-1)^{K+M}}{\sqrt{2K+1}}\\
&\times \left[ Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{aA}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf r}_{ac})\right]^K_M \left[Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf k}_{a}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{a})\right]^K_{-M}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Thus,
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG13}
\begin{split}
\left[ Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{aA}) Y^{l_a} (\hat{ \mathbf k}_{a})\right]^0_0 & \left[ Y^{l'_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{ac}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{a})\right]^0_0=\sqrt{\frac{1}{(2l'_a+1)(2l_a+1)}}\\
&\times\sum_{KM}(-1)^{K+M}\left[ Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{aA}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf r}_{ac})\right]^K_M \left[Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf k}_{a}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{a})\right]^K_{-M}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
One can further simplify the above expression by choosing the direction of the initial momentum to be parallel to the $z$ axis, so that $Y^{l_a}_m (\hat{\mathbf k}_{a})=Y^{l_a}_m (\hat{\mathbf z})=\sqrt{\frac{2l_a+1}{4\pi}}\delta_{m,0}$. Then,
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppF10}
\begin{split}
\left[ Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{aA}) Y^{l_a} (\hat{ \mathbf k}_{a})\right]^0_0 & \left[ Y^{l'_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{ac}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{a})\right]^0_0=\sqrt{\frac{1}{4\pi(2l'_a+1)}}\sum_{KM}(-1)^{K+M}\\
&\times\langle l_a\;0\;l'_a\;-M|K\;-M\rangle\left[ Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{aA}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf r}_{ac})\right]^K_M   Y^{l'_a}_{-M} (\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{a}).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
For  particle $b$ we have
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppF15}
\begin{split}
Y^{l_b}_{m_b}(\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{bc})\left[ Y^{l'_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc}) Y^{l'_b} (\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{b})\right]^0_0=Y^{l_b}_{m_b}(\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{cb})\sum_m \frac{(-1)^{l'_b+m}}{\sqrt{2l'_b+1}}Y^{l'_b}_m (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc})Y^{l'_b}_{-m} (\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{b}),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and can write
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG16}
\begin{split}
Y^{l_b}_{m_b}(\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{bc})Y^{l'_b}_m (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc})=\sum_{K'}\langle l_b\;m_b\;l'_b\;m|K'\;m_b+m\rangle \left[ Y^{l_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc}) Y^{l'_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc})\right]^{K'}_{m_b+m}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
In order to couple to 0 angular momentum with (\ref{eqC6AppF10}) we must only keep the term with  $K'=K,\;m=-M-m_b$ so
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG17}
\begin{split}
Y^{l_b}_{m_b}(\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{bc})&\left[ Y^{l'_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc}) Y^{l'_b} (\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{b})\right]^0_0=\frac{(-1)^{l'_b-M-m_b}}{\sqrt{2l'_b+1}}\langle l_b\;m_b\;l'_b\;-M-m_b|K\;-M\rangle\\
&\times \left[ Y^{l_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc}) Y^{l'_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc})\right]^{K}_{-M}Y^{l'_b}_{-M-m_b} (\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{b}),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and (\ref{eqC6AppF14}) becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG18}
\begin{split}
\frac{32\pi^2}{k_ak'_ak'_b}&\sum_{KM}(-1)^{K+l'_b-m_b}\langle l_a\;0\;l'_a\;-M|K\;-M\rangle\langle l_b\;m_b\;l'_b\;-M-m_b|K\;-M\rangle\\

\end{split}
\end{equation}
Note that
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG19}
\begin{split}
\left[ Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{aA}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf r}_{ac})\right]^K_M &   \left[ Y^{l_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc}) Y^{l'_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc})\right]^{K}_{-M}=\sum_P \langle K\;M\;K\;-M|P\;0\rangle\\

\end{split}
\end{equation}
and that to survive the integration the rotational tensors must be coupled to $P=0$. Keeping only this term in the sum over $P$, we get
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppF17}
\begin{split}
\left[ Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{aA}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf r}_{ac})\right]^K_M &   \left[ Y^{l_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc}) Y^{l'_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc})\right]^{K}_{-M}=\\

\caption{Coordinates in the ``standard'' configuration.}\label{figC6AppF2}
\end{figure}
The coordinate--dependent part of the latter expression is  a rotationally invariant scalar, so it can be evaluated in any conventional ``standard'' configuration such as the one depicted in Fig. \ref{figC6AppF2}. It must then be multiplied by a factor resulting of the integration of the remaining angular variables, which accounts for the rigid rotations needed to connect any arbitrary configuration to one of this type. This factor turns out to be $8\pi^2$ (a $4\pi$ factor for all possible orientations of, say, $\mathbf r_{aA}$ and a $2\pi$ factor for a complete rotation around its direction). According to Fig. \ref{figC6AppF2},
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppF22}
\begin{split}
\mathbf{r}_{bc}&=r_{bc}\left(\sin \theta\, \hat x+\cos \theta\,\hat z \right),\\
\mathbf{r}_{aA}&=-r_{aA}\,\hat z,\\
\mathbf{r}_{ac}&=\frac{b}{A}r_{bc}\sin \theta\,\hat x+\left(\frac{b}{A}r_{bc}\cos \theta-r_{aA}\right)\,\hat z.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
As $\mathbf{r}_{aA}$ lies parallel to the $z$ axis, $Y^{l_a}_{M_K} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{aA})=\sqrt{\frac{2l_a+1}{4\pi}}\delta_{M_K,0}$ and
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG22}
\begin{split}
\left[ Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{aA})\right.&\left. Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf r}_{ac})\right]^K_{M_K}=\sum_{m}\langle l_a\;m\;l'_a\;M_K-m|K\;M_K\rangle Y^{l_a}_{m} (\hat{ \mathbf r}_{aA})Y^{l'_a}_{M_K-m} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{ac})=\\
&\sqrt{\frac{2l_a+1}{4\pi}} \langle l_a\;0\;l'_a\;M_K|K\;M_K\rangle Y^{l'_a}_{M_K} (\hat{ \mathbf r}_{ac}).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Then
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG23}
\begin{split}
&\left\{\left[ Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{aA}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf r}_{ac})\right]^K\left[ Y^{l_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc}) Y^{l'_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc})\right]^{K} \right\}^0_0=\\
&\sum_{M_K}\langle K\;M_K\;K\;-M_K|0\;0\rangle \left[ Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{aA}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf r}_{ac})\right]^K_{M_K}\left[ Y^{l_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc}) Y^{l'_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc})\right]^{K}_{-M_K}=\\
&\sqrt{\frac{2l_a+1}{4\pi}}\sum_{M_K}\frac{(-1)^{K+M_K}}{\sqrt{2K+1}} \langle l_a\;0\;l'_a\;M_K|K\;M_K\rangle\\
&\times \left[ Y^{l_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc}) Y^{l'_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc})\right]^{K}_{-M_K} Y^{l'_a}_{M_K} (\hat{ \mathbf r}_{ac}).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Remembering the $8\pi^2$ factor, the term arising from (\ref{eqC6AppF17}) to be considered in the integral is
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG24}
\begin{split}
4\pi^{3/2}\frac{\sqrt{2l_a+1}}{2K+1}&(-1)^K\sum_{M_K}(-1)^{M_K} \langle l_a\;0\;l'_a\;M_K|K\;M_K\rangle\\
&\times \left[ Y^{l_b} (\cos \theta,0) Y^{l'_b} (\cos \theta,0)\right]^{K}_{-M_K} Y^{l'_a}_{M_K} (\cos \theta_{ac},0),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG25}
\cos \theta_{ac}=\frac{\frac{b}{A}r_{bc}\cos \theta-r_{aA}}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{b}{A}r_{bc}\sin \theta\right)^2+\left(\frac{b}{A}r_{bc}\cos \theta-r_{aA}\right)^2}},
\end{equation}
(see (\ref{eqC6AppF22})). The final expression of the transition amplitude is
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG26}
\begin{split}
T_{m_b}(\mathbf{k}'_a,\mathbf{k}'_b)=\frac{128\pi^{7/2}}{k_ak'_ak'_b}&\sum_{KM}\frac{(-1)^{l'_b+m_b}}{2K+1}\langle l_a\;0\;l'_a\;-M|K\;-M\rangle\langle l_b\;m_b\;l'_b\;-M-m_b|K\;-M\rangle\\
&\times \sum_{l_a,l'_a,l'_b}(2l_a+1) e^{i(\sigma^{l_a}+\sigma^{l'_a}+\sigma^{l'_b})}Y^{l'_b}_{-M-m_b} (\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{b}) Y^{l'_a}_{-M} (\hat{ \mathbf k}'_{a})\,\mathcal I(l_a,l_a',l_b',K),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG27}
\begin{split}
\mathcal I(l_a,l_a'&,l_b',K)=\int dr_{aA} dr_{bc}d\theta r_{aA}r_{bc} \frac{\sin \theta}{r_{ac}} u_{l_b}(r_{bc})v(r_{ab})F_{l_a}(r_{aA})  F_{l'_a}(r_{ac})F_{l'_b}(r_{bc}) \\

\end{split}
\end{equation}
is a 3--dimensional integral that can be numerically evaluated with the help of, e.g., Gaussian integration.
\subsection{Particles with spin}
 \begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics*[width=10cm,angle=0]{C6/figs_C6/knock2.pdf}}
\vspace{-4cm}
\caption{In the present case all three clusters $a,b,c$ have definite spins and projections. The nucleus $A$ is coupled to total spin $J_A,M_A$.}\label{figC6AppF3}
\end{figure}
We  now treat  the case in which the clusters have a definite spin (see Fig. \ref{figC6AppF3}),  and the complex  optical potentials $U(r_{aA}),U(r_{cb}),U(r_{ac})$ contain now  a spin--orbit term proportional to the  product $\mathbf l \cdot \mathbf s=1/2(j(j+1)-l(l+1)-3/4)$ for particles with spin 1/2. In addition, the interaction $V(r_{ab},\boldsymbol\sigma_a,\boldsymbol\sigma_b)$ between $a$ and $b$ is taken to be a separable function of the distance $r_{ab}$ and of the spin orientations, $V(r_{ab},\boldsymbol\sigma_a,\boldsymbol\sigma_b)=v(r_{ab})v_\sigma(\boldsymbol\sigma_a,\boldsymbol\sigma_b)$. Note that this ansatz rules out spin--orbit as well as tensor terms in the $NN$--interaction. For the time being we will assume that the spin--dependent interaction is rotationally invariant (scalar with respect to rotations), such as, e.g., $v_\sigma(\boldsymbol\sigma_a,\boldsymbol\sigma_b)\propto\boldsymbol\sigma_a \cdot\boldsymbol\sigma_b$. Again, this assumption excludes tensor terms in the interaction. The transition amplitude is then,
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppF28}
\begin{split}
T_{m_a,m_b}^{m'_a,m'_b}=\sum_{\sigma_a,\sigma_b}\int d\mathbf{r}_{aA}d \mathbf{r}_{bc}&\chi^{(-)*}_{m'_a}(\mathbf{r}_{ac},\sigma_a)\chi^{(-)*}_{m'_b}(\mathbf{r}_{bc},\sigma_b)\\
&\times v(r_{ab})v_\sigma(\sigma_a,\sigma_b)\chi^{(+)}_{m_a}(\mathbf{r}_{aA},\sigma_a)\psi_{m_b}^{l_b,j_b}(\mathbf{r}_{bc},\sigma_b).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Distorted waves}
The distorted waves in (\ref{eqC6AppF28}) $\chi_{m}(\mathbf{r},\sigma)=\chi(\mathbf{r})\phi^{1/2}_m(\sigma)$ have a spin dependence contained in the spinor $\phi^{1/2}_m(\sigma)$, where $\sigma$ is the spin degree of freedom and $m$ the projection of the spin along the quantization axis. The superscript $1/2$ reminds us that we are considering spin $1/2$ particles, which have important consequences when dealing with the spin--orbit term of the optical potentials. As for the spin--dependent term $v_\sigma(\boldsymbol\sigma_a,\boldsymbol\sigma_b)$, the actual value of the spin of  particles involved in the reaction process do not make much difference, \emph{as long as this term is rotationally invariant}. Following (\ref{eqC6AppF2}),
 \begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG29}
\chi^{(+)}(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{r})\phi_m(\sigma)= \sum_{l,j}\frac{4\pi}{k r} i^{l}\sqrt{2l+1}
e^{i\sigma^{l}} F_{l,j}(r) \left[ Y^{l} (\hat {\mathbf{r}}) Y^{l} (\hat {\mathbf{k}})\right]^0_0\phi^{1/2}_m(\sigma).
\end{equation}
Note that now one  also sums over the total angular momentum $j$, as the radial functions $F_{l,j}(r)$ depend both on $j$ as well as on $l$, in keeping with the fact that they are solutions of an optical potential containing a spin--orbit term proportional to $1/2\left(j(j+1)-l(l+1)-3/4\right)$. One must then couple the radial and spin functions to total angular momentum $j$, noting that 
 \begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG30}
 \begin{split}
\left[ Y^{l} (\hat {\mathbf{r}}) \right. & \left. Y^{l} (\hat {\mathbf{k}})\right]^0_0\phi^{1/2}_m(\sigma)=\sum_{m_l} \langle l\;m_l\;l\;-m_l|0\;0\rangle Y^{l}_{m_l} (\hat {\mathbf{r}})Y^{l}_{-m_l} (\hat {\mathbf{k}})\phi^{1/2}_m(\sigma)=\\
&\sum_{m_l} \frac{(-1)^{l-m_l}}{\sqrt{2l+1}} Y^{l}_{m_l} (\hat {\mathbf{r}})Y^{l}_{-m_l} (\hat {\mathbf{k}})\phi^{1/2}_m(\sigma),
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
and
 \begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG31}
 Y^{l}_{m_l} (\hat {\mathbf{r}})\phi^{1/2}_m(\sigma)=\sum_j \langle l\;m_l\;1/2\;m|j\;m_l+m\rangle \left[ Y^{l} (\hat {\mathbf{r}})\phi^{1/2}(\sigma)\right]^j_{m_l+m},
\end{equation}
we can write
 \begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG32}
 \begin{split}
\left[ Y^{l} (\hat {\mathbf{r}}) \right. & \left. Y^{l} (\hat {\mathbf{k}})\right]^0_0\phi^{1/2}_m(\sigma)=\sum_{m_l,j} \frac{(-1)^{l+m_l}}{\sqrt{2l+1}} \langle l\;m_l\;1/2\;m|j\;m_l+m\rangle \\
&\times \left[ Y^{l} (\hat {\mathbf{r}})\phi^{1/2}(\sigma)\right]^j_{m_l+m}Y^{l}_{-m_l} (\hat {\mathbf{k}}),
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
and the distorted waves in (\ref{eqC6AppF28}) are
 \begin{equation}\label{eq33}
\begin{split} 
\chi^{(+)}_{m_a}(\mathbf{r}_{aA},&\mathbf{k}_{a},\sigma_a)= \sum_{l_a,m_{l_a},j_a}\frac{4\pi}{k_a r_{aA}} i^{l_a}(-1)^{l_a+m_{l_a}}
e^{i\sigma^{l_a}} F_{l_a,j_a}(r_{aA})\\
 &\times\langle l_a\;m_{l_a}\;1/2\;m_a|j_a\;m_{l_a}+m_a\rangle

\end{split} 
\end{equation}
 \begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppF34}
\begin{split} 
\chi^{(-)*}_{m'_b}(\mathbf{r}_{bc},&\mathbf{k}'_{b},\sigma_b)= \sum_{l'_b,m_{l'_b},j'_b}\frac{4\pi}{k'_b r_{bc}} i^{-l'_b}(-1)^{l'_b+m_{l'_b}}
e^{i\sigma^{l'_b}} F_{l'_b,j'_b}(r_{bc})\\
 &\times\langle l'_b\;m_{l'_b}\;1/2\;m'_b|j'_b\;m_{l'_b}+m'_b\rangle
 \left[ Y^{l'_b} (\hat {\mathbf{r}}_{bc})\phi^{1/2}(\sigma_b)\right]^{j'_b*}_{m_{l'_b}+m'_b}Y^{l'_b*}_{-m_{l'_b}} (\hat {\mathbf{k}}'_b),
\end{split} 
\end{equation}
 \begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG35}
\begin{split} 
\chi^{(-)*}_{m'_a}(\mathbf{r}_{ac},&\mathbf{k}'_{a},\sigma_a)= \sum_{l'_a,m_{l'_a},j'_a}\frac{4\pi}{k'_a r_{ac}} i^{-l'_a}(-1)^{l'_a+m_{l'_a}}
e^{i\sigma^{l'_a}} F_{l'_a,j'_a}(r_{ac})\\
 &\times\langle l'_a\;m_{l'_a}\;1/2\;m'_a|j'_a\;m_{l'_a}+m'_a\rangle
 \left[ Y^{l'_a} (\hat {\mathbf{r}}_{ac})\phi^{1/2}(\sigma_a)\right]^{j'_a*}_{m_{l'_a}+m'_a}Y^{l'_a*}_{-m_{l'_a}} (\hat {\mathbf{k}}'_a).
\end{split} 
\end{equation}
The initial bound particle $b$ wavefunction	  is
 \begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG36}
\psi_{m_b}^{l_b,j_b}(\mathbf{r}_{bc},\sigma_b)=u_{l_b,j_b}(r_{bc})\left[ Y^{l_b} (\hat {\mathbf{r}}_{bc})\phi^{1/2}(\sigma_b)\right]^{j_b}_{m_b},
\end{equation}
Substituting in (\ref{eqC6AppF28}), one obtains,

\begin{multline}\label{eqC6AppG37}
T_{m_a,m_b}^{m'_a,m'_b}(\mathbf{k}'_a,\mathbf{k}'_b)=\frac{64\pi^3}{k_ak'_ak'_b}\sum_{\sigma_a,\sigma_b}\sum_{l_a,m_{l_a},j_a}\sum_{l'_a,m_{l'_a},j'_a}\sum_{l'_b,m_{l'_b},j'_b}
 e^{i(\sigma^{l_a}+\sigma^{l'_a}+\sigma^{l'_b})}i^{l_a-l'_a-l'_b}(-1)^{l_a-m_{l_a}+l'_a-j'_a+l'_b-j'_b}\\

\times\left[ Y^{l_a} (\hat {\mathbf{r}}_{aA})\phi^{1/2}(\sigma_a)\right]^{j_a}_{m_{l_a}+m_a}\left[ Y^{l_b} (\hat {\mathbf{r}}_{bc})\phi^{1/2}(\sigma_b)\right]^{j_b}_{m_b},
\end{multline}
where  use was made of the relation
 \begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG38}
\left[ Y^{l} (\hat {\mathbf{r}})\phi^{1/2}(\sigma)\right]^{j*}_{m}=(-1)^{j-m}\left[Y^{l} (\hat {\mathbf{r}})\phi^{1/2}(\sigma)\right]^{j}_{-m}.
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Recoupling of angular momenta}
Let us now separate spatial and spin coordinates, noting that the spin functions must be coupled to $S=0$, a consequence of the fact that the  interaction $v_\sigma(\sigma_a,\sigma_b)$ is rotationally invariant. Starting with particle $a$,
\begin{multline}\label{eqC6AppF38}
\left[ Y^{l'_a} (\hat {\mathbf{r}}_{ac})\phi^{1/2^*}(\sigma_a)\right]^{j'_a}_{-m_{l'_a}-m'_a}\left[ Y^{l_a} (\hat {\mathbf{r}}_{aA})\phi^{1/2}(\sigma_a)\right]^{j_a}_{m_{l_a}+m_a}=\\
\sum_K \bigl((l'_a \tfrac{1}{2})_{j'_a}(l_a \tfrac{1}{2})_{j_a}|(l_a l'_a)_K(\tfrac{1}{2} \tfrac{1}{2})_0\bigr)_K\\
\times \left[ Y^{l'_a} (\hat {\mathbf{r}}_{ac})Y^{l_a} (\hat {\mathbf{r}}_{aA})\right]^{K}_{-m_{l'_a}-m'_a+m_{l_a}+m_a}\left[\phi^{1/2^*}(\sigma_a)\phi^{1/2}(\sigma_a)\right]^0_0.
\end{multline}
For particle $b$,
\begin{multline}\label{eqC6AppF39}
\left[ Y^{l'_b} (\hat {\mathbf{r}}_{bc})\phi^{1/2^*}(\sigma_b)\right]^{j'_b}_{-m_{l'_b}-m'_b}\left[ Y^{l_b} (\hat {\mathbf{r}}_{bc})\phi^{1/2}(\sigma_b)\right]^{j_b}_{m_b}=\\
\sum_{K'} \bigl((l'_b \tfrac{1}{2})_{j'_b}(l_b \tfrac{1}{2})_{j_b}|(l_b l'_b)_{K'}(\tfrac{1}{2} \tfrac{1}{2})_0\bigr)_{K'}\\
\times \left[ Y^{l'_b} (\hat {\mathbf{r}}_{bc})Y^{l_b} (\hat {\mathbf{r}}_{bc})\right]^{K'}_{-m_{l'_b}-m'_b+m_b}\left[\phi^{1/2^*}(\sigma_b)\phi^{1/2}(\sigma_b)\right]^0_0.
\end{multline}
The spin summation yields a constant factor,
 \begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG41}
\sum_{\sigma_a,\sigma_b}\left[\phi^{1/2^*}(\sigma_a)\phi^{1/2}(\sigma_a)\right]^0_0\left[\phi^{1/2^*}(\sigma_b)\phi^{1/2}(\sigma_b)\right]^0_0v_\sigma(\sigma_a,\sigma_b)\equiv T_\sigma,
\end{equation}
and what we have yet to do is very similar to what we have done in the case of spinless particles. First of all note that the constrain of coupling all angular momenta to 0, imposes $K'=K$ and $m_{l_a}+m_a-m_{l'_a}-m'_a=m_{l'_b}+m'_b-m_b$ (see (\ref{eqC6AppF38}) and (\ref{eqC6AppF39})). If we set $M=m_{l_a}+m_a-m_{l'_a}-m'_a$ and take, as before, $\hat {\mathbf{k}}_a\equiv \hat z$
\begin{multline}\label{eqC6AppG42}
T_{m_a,m_b}^{m'_a,m'_b}(\mathbf{k}'_a,\mathbf{k}'_b)=\frac{32\pi^{5/2}}{k_ak'_ak'_b}T_\sigma\sum_{l_a,j_a}\sum_{l'_a,j'_a}\sum_{l'_b,j'_b}\sum_{K,M}
 e^{i(\sigma^{l_a}+\sigma^{l'_a}+\sigma^{l'_b})}i^{l_a-l'_a-l'_b}(-1)^{l_a+l'_a+l'_b-j'_a-j'_b}\\
 \times \sqrt{2l_a+1}\bigl((l'_a \tfrac{1}{2})_{j'_a}(l_a \tfrac{1}{2})_{j_a}|(l_a l'_a)_K(\tfrac{1}{2} \tfrac{1}{2})_0\bigr)_K\,\bigl((l'_b \tfrac{1}{2})_{j'_b}(l_b \tfrac{1}{2})_{j_b}|(l_b l'_b)_{K}(\tfrac{1}{2} \tfrac{1}{2})_0\bigr)_{K}\\
\times \langle l'_a\;m_a-m'_a-M\;1/2\;m'_a|j'_a\;m_a-M\rangle \langle l_a\;0\;1/2\;m_a|j_a\;m_a\rangle\langle l'_b\;m_b-m'_b+M\;1/2\;m'_b|j'_b\;M+m_b\rangle\\
\times Y^{l'_b}_{m'_b-m_b-M} (\hat {\mathbf{k}}'_b)Y^{l'_a}_{m'_a-m_a+M} (\hat {\mathbf{k}}'_a)
\int d\mathbf{r}_{aA}d \mathbf{r}_{bc}\frac{F_{l_a,j_a}(r_{aA})  F_{l'_a,j'_a}(r_{ac})F_{l'_b,j'_b}(r_{bc})}{r_{ac}r_{aA}r_{bc}}\\
\times u_{l_b,j_b}(r_{bc})v(r_{ab})\left[ Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{aA}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf r}_{ac})\right]^K_M   \left[ Y^{l_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc}) Y^{l'_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc})\right]^{K}_{-M}.
\end{multline}
The integral of the above expression is similar to the one in (\ref{eqC6AppG18}), so we obtain
\begin{multline}\label{eqC6AppG43}
T_{m_a,m_b}^{m'_a,m'_b}(\mathbf{k}'_a,\mathbf{k}'_b)=\frac{128\pi^{4}}{k_ak'_ak'_b}T_\sigma\sum_{l_a,j_a}\sum_{l'_a,j'_a}\sum_{l'_b,j'_b}\sum_{K,M}

Again, this is a 3--dimensional integral that can be evaluated with the method of Gaussian quadratures. The transition amplitude $T_{m_a,m_b}^{m'_a,m'_b}(\mathbf{k}'_a,\mathbf{k}'_b)$ depends explicitly on the initial ($m_a,m'_a$) and final ($m'_a,m'_b$) polarizations of $a,b$. If the particle $b$ is initially coupled to core $c$ to total angular momentum $J_A,M_A$, the amplitude to be considered is rather
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG45}
T_{m_a}^{m'_a,m'_b}(\mathbf{k}'_a,\mathbf{k}'_b)=\sum_{m_b}\langle j_b\;m_b\;j_c\;M_A-m_b|J_A\;M_A\rangle\, T_{m_a,m_b}^{m'_a,m'_b}(\mathbf{k}'_a,\mathbf{k}'_b),
\end{equation}
and the multi--differential cross section for detecting particle $c$ (or $a$) is
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG46}
\left.\frac{d\sigma}{d\mathbf{k}'_ad\mathbf{k}'_b}\right]_{m_a}^{m'_a,m'_b}=\frac{k'_a}{k_a}\frac{\mu_{aA}\mu_{ac}}{4\pi^2\hbar^4}\left|\sum_{m_b}\langle j_b\;m_b\;j_c\;M_A-m_b|J_A\;M_A\rangle\, T_{m_a,m_b}^{m'_a,m'_b}(\mathbf{k}'_a,\mathbf{k}'_b)\right|^2.
\end{equation}
All spin--polarization observables (analysing powers, etc.,) can be derived from this expression. But let us now work out the expression of the cross section for an unpolarized beam (sum over initial spin orientations divided by the number of such orientations) and when we do not detect the final polarizations (sum over final spin orientations), 
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG47}
\begin{split}
\frac{d\sigma}{d\mathbf{k}'_ad\mathbf{k}'_b}&=\frac{k'_a}{k_a}\frac{\mu_{aA}\mu_{ac}}{4\pi^2\hbar^4}\frac{1}{(2J_A+1)(2j_a+1)}\\
&\times \sum_{\substack{m_a,m'_a\\M_A,m'_b}}\left|\sum_{m_b}\langle j_b\;m_b\;j_c\;M_A-m_b|J_A\;M_A\rangle\, T_{m_a,m_b}^{m'_a,m'_b}(\mathbf{k}'_a,\mathbf{k}'_b)\right|^2.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The sum above can be simplified a bit. Let us consider a single particular value of $m_b$ in the sum over $m_b$,
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG48}
\begin{split}
\sum_{m_a,m'_a,m'_b}&\left|T_{m_a,m_b}^{m'_a,m'_b}(\mathbf{k}'_a,\mathbf{k}'_b)\right|^2\sum_{M_A}\Big|\langle j_b\;m_b\;j_c\;M_A-m_b|J_A\;M_A\rangle\Big|^2=\\
&\frac{2J_A+1}{2j_b+1}\sum_{m_a,m_a,m'_b}\left|T_{m_a,m_b}^{m'_a,m'_b}(\mathbf{k}'_a,\mathbf{k}'_b)\right|^2\\
&\times\sum_{M_A}\Big|\langle J_A\;-M_A\;j_c\;M_A-m_b|j_b\;m_b\rangle\Big|^2,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where we have used
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG49}
\langle j_b\;m_b\;j_c\;M_A-m_b|J_A\;M_A\rangle=(-1)^{j_c-M_A+m_b}\sqrt{\frac{2J_A+1}{2j_b+1}}\langle J_A\;-M_A\;j_c\;M_A-m_b|j_b\;m_b\rangle.
\end{equation}
As
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG50}
\sum_{M_A}\Big|\langle J_A\;-M_A\;j_c\;M_A-m_b|j_b\;m_b\rangle\Big|^2=1,
\end{equation}
we finally have
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG51}
\begin{split}
\frac{d\sigma}{d\mathbf{k}'_ad\mathbf{k}'_b}&=\frac{k'_a}{k_a}\frac{\mu_{aA}\mu_{ac}}{4\pi^2\hbar^4}\frac{1}{(2j_b+1)(2j_a+1)}\sum_{\substack{m_a,m'_a,m'_b}}\left|\sum_{m_b} T_{m_a,m_b}^{m'_a,m'_b}(\mathbf{k}'_a,\mathbf{k}'_b)\right|^2.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Zero range approximation.}
The zero range approximation (Eq. (\ref{eqC6AppE15})) consists, in the present case to assume  $v(r_{ab})=D_0\delta(r_{ab})$. Then, (see (\ref{eqC6AppF22}))
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG52}
\begin{split}
\mathbf{r}_{aA}&=\frac{c}{A}\mathbf{r}_{bc},\\
\mathbf{r}_{ac}&=\mathbf{r}_{bc}.
\end{split} 
\end{equation}
The angular dependence of the integral can be readily evaluated. From (\ref{eq17}), noting that $\hat{\mathbf r}_{aA}=\hat{\mathbf r}_{ac}=\hat{\mathbf r}_{bc}\equiv \hat{\mathbf r}$,
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG53}
\begin{split}
\left[ Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf r})\right]^K_M &   \left[ Y^{l_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}) Y^{l'_b} (\hat{\mathbf r})\right]^{K}_{-M}=\\
&\frac{(-1)^{K-M}}{\sqrt{2K+1}}\left\{\left[ Y^{l_a} (\hat{\mathbf r}) Y^{l'_a} (\hat{ \mathbf r})\right]^K\left[ Y^{l_b} (\hat{\mathbf r}) Y^{l'_b} (\hat{\mathbf r})\right]^{K} \right\}^0_0.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can as before evaluate this expression in the configuration shown in Fig. \ref{figC6AppF2} ($\hat{\mathbf r}=\hat z$), but now the multiplicative factor is $4\pi$. The corresponding contribution to the integral is
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG54}
\frac{(-1)^K}{4\pi(2K+1)}\langle l_a\;0\;l'_a\;0|K\;0\rangle\sqrt{(2l_a+1)(2l'_a+1)(2l_b+1)(2l'_b+1)},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{multline}\label{eqC6AppG55}
T_{m_a,m_b}^{m'_a,m'_b}(\mathbf{k}'_a,\mathbf{k}'_b)=\frac{16\pi^{2}}{k_ak'_ak'_b}\frac{c}{A}D_0T_\sigma\sum_{l_a,j_a}\sum_{l'_a,j'_a}\sum_{l'_b,j'_b}\sum_{K,M}

\mathcal I_{ZR}(l_a,l'_a,l'_b,j_a,j'_a,j'_b),
\end{multline}
where now the 1--dimensional integral to solve is
\begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG56}
\mathcal I_{ZR}(l_a,l'_a,l'_b,j_a,j'_a,j'_b)=\int dr u_{l_b}(r)F_{l_a,j_a}(\tfrac{c}{A}r)  F_{l'_a,j'_a}(r)F_{l'_b,j'_b}(r)/r.

\end{figure}
\subsection{One-particle transfer}
We now state the expression for the one-particle transfer reaction within the present context and using similar elements. In this way one can better compare the corresponding types of experiments. In particle transfer, the final state of $b$ is a bound state of the $B(=a+b)$ nucleus (cf. Fig. \ref{fig6G4}), and we can carry on in a similar way as done previously just by substituting the distorted wave (continuum) wave function (\ref{eqC6AppF34}) with
 \begin{equation}\label{eqC6AppG57}
\psi_{m'_b}^{l'_b,j'_b*}(\mathbf{r}_{ab},\sigma_b)=u^*_{l'_b,j'_b}(r_{ab})\left[ Y^{l'_b} (\hat {\mathbf{r}}_{ab})\phi^{1/2}(\sigma_b)\right]^{j'_b*}_{m'_b},
\end{equation}
so the transition amplitude is now
\begin{multline}\label{eqC6AppG58}
T_{m_a,m_b}^{m'_a,m'_b}(\mathbf{k}'_a)=\frac{8\pi^{3/2}}{k_ak'_a}\sum_{\sigma_a,\sigma_b}\sum_{l_a,j_a}\sum_{l'_a,m_{l'_a},j'_a}

Using (\ref{eqC6AppF38}), (\ref{eqC6AppF39}), (\ref{eq40}), and setting $M=m_a-m'_a-m_{l'_a}$

\section{Dynamical shell model in a nutshell}\label{C6AppI}
In the extreme shell model the nucleons move independently of each other in  the average potential. The properly normalized probability for removing a nucleon from such orbitals is equal to 1 for $\omega$ equal to the (unperturbed) energy of the orbital in question and zero otherwise (see Fig. \ref{fig8.F.1} (\textbf{a})).

In the dynamical shell model\footnote{\cite{Mahaux:85} and references therein; in connection with Eq. (\ref{eq5.8.1}) see Sect. 4.7 (in particular Eq. (4.7.20)) of this reference.}, the nucleons can bounce inelastically off the nuclear surface setting the nucleus in a vibrational state,  changing their state of motion as well as remaining in the same state. In this case the strength of the levels becomes, in general, distributed over a range of energies both below and above the Fermi energy. That is, the state $k$ is found both in the system $(A-1)$ populated in a pick-up process and in the system $(A+1)$ populated through a stripping reaction, as indicated in Fig \ref{fig8.F.1} (\textbf{b}).



The next question is whether this distribution is concentrated in discrete states or displays a continuous behavior. Both situations can in principle be found depending of whether the original single-particle state is close or far away from the Fermi energy. The sum of the strength functions associated with all the states excited in the pick-up process of a nucleon with quantum numbers $k$ gives the occupation number associated with the orbital, i.e. $\int_{-\infty}^{\epsilon_F}S_{h}(k;\omega)d\omega=n_k$, where $S_h$ is the (hole) strength function (see Fig. \ref{fig1.2.5}). The full single--particle strength is found adding to this quantity that associated with the excitation of states in the $(A+1)$ system where a particle with quantum numbers $k$ is deposited in the target.



It is noted that the fact that in the dynamical shell model the single-particle strength is distributed not only over an energy range in the ($A-1$) system but also in the $(A+1)$ system is intimately connected with the ground state correlations associated with the vibrational modes which produce particle-hole excitations in the ground state as well as  pair addition and subtraction modes. In this way single-particle states which originally were filled become partially empty, and vice versa (see Fig. \ref{fig0.5.3}).


The transfer process shown in Fig. \ref{fig8.F.1} (\textbf{b}) for both stripping and pick--up reactions are closely associated with the polarization and correlation contributions to the mass operator $\mathcal M(k;\omega)=\mathcal V(k;\omega)+i\mathcal W(k;\omega)$. The associated total strength distribution
 \begin{align}\label{eq5.8.1}
 \nonumber S(k;\omega)&=S_h(k;\omega)+S_p(k;\omega),\\
 &=\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{\mathcal W(k;\omega)+\Delta}{(E_k+\mathcal V(k;\omega)-E)^2+\frac{1}{4}\left(\mathcal W(k;\omega)+\Delta\right)^2},
 \end{align}
can display a variety of shapes, as $\mathcal V(k;\omega)$ and $\mathcal W(k;\omega)$ are energy dependent.


The intermediate states of the polarization and correlation diagrams which, in the present discussion are the doorway states to the renormalization of the single-particle motion, must be furthermore mixed with more complicated configurations. The extension to the complex plane of the associated expressions in terms of an imaginary parameter $\Delta$ is made to take these effects into account in some average way (see Sect. \ref{appintroD}). In any case, most of the results are not dependent on the detailed value this quantity has. 
The picture shown in Fig. \ref{fig8.F.1} (\textbf{b}), although accurate and controlled by only few parameters, is much too rich as compared to the originally, extreme shell model picture. 

Within this context,
a major simplification can be achieved recognizing that the essential difference between the situation depicted in Figs \ref{fig8.F.1} (\textbf{a}) and (\textbf{b}) is the value of the mean free path. In the first case it is infinite while in the second it is finite. That is, due to the coupling to the surface modes (and eventually pair modes) single-particle motion acquires a lifetime. In other terms, the coupling to doorway states leads to a breaking of the single-particle strength (see e.g. Fig. \ref{fig6.2.3}). The associated energy range (width $\Gamma$), over which this phenomenon takes place, provides insight into the time it takes for the different components to come out of phase ($\approx \hbar/\Gamma$). 

Making the ansatz that the single-particle motion decays exponentially, a Breit-Wigner shape can be fitted to the different strength concentration resulting from the detailed calculation (Fig. \ref{fig8.F.1} (\textbf{b})) The centroid of the corresponding peaks can be viewed as the energy of the dressed single-particle state. On the other hand, caution should be exercised in interpreting the area under the fitted curve as single-particle content (spectroscopic factor), if only because this quantity can become larger than one (Fig. \ref{fig8.F.1} (\textbf{c})). It is only for the levels not too far away from the Fermi energy that such interpretation can   be reasonably accurate.


Another quantity which can be used to characterize the dressed single-particle states is the rate of change of the energy shift as a function of the energy, i.e. the effective mass. Again, for the orbitals close to the Fermi energy this quantity is inversely proportional to the area under the Breit-Wigner shapes. The energy range over which the effective mass deviates from one determine the region where the dynamical couplings change the density of single-particle levels (see Sect. \ref{C4AppA1}, in particular Eq. (\ref{eq4A18x})).



The trend of the effective masses shown in Fig. \ref{fig8.F.1} (\textbf{d}) can be quantitatively understood as follows. For single-particle states close to the Fermi energy the intermediate states have all energies larger than the unperturbed single--particle energy, and the resulting shape is $\delta$-like with a tail extending away from the Fermi energy. For single-particle orbitals 5--7 MeV away from $\epsilon_F$ there are a number of intermediate states which have the same energy of the initial state leading to vanishing energy denominators and thus to a marked structure in the strength function. Finally, for single--particle states far away from $\epsilon_F$, the density of intermediate states is so large that the matrix elements of these couplings average out to a constant with a value much larger than typical distances between successive intermediate states. These are the conditions which lead to a Breit-Wigner shape.  


It is then to be expected that the single--particle levels in the intermediate region will be associated with strength functions which deviate much from a smooth function and for which comparatively large errors can be made through a Breit-Wigner fitting. This is also seen from Fig. \ref{fig8.F.1} (d) where the effective mass becomes smaller than one, indicating that the area of the fitted shapes are larger than that of the original strength function $S(k;\omega)$. This result emphasizes the difficulties found in trying to extract spectroscopic factors from the data in a general situation.


        \begin{figure}
        \centerline{\includegraphics*[width=22cm,angle=90]{C6/figs_C6/fig4I1.pdf}}
        	\caption{}\label{fig8.F.1}
        \end{figure}


Starting from the extreme picture shown in Fig. \ref{fig8.F.1} (a) where the relation $\omega=\hbar^2k^2/2m$ holds, one arrives at the picture (c) where the relation $d\omega=\hbar^2k\delta k/m^*$ again accounts for the main properties of the single-particle motion and where the effect of the couplings are contained in $m^*$ (see Eq. (\ref{eq4.A.3})).

The question then arises of how to define an average quantity which depends only on the energy of the orbital and is state independent. Rather different prescriptions have been used to deal with the question. In any case the main result obtained was that the $\omega$--dependent effective mass shows a well defined peak at the Fermi surface, its maximum value being considerably larger than one ($\approx 1.4$). The associated full width at half maximum is of the order of 10 MeV (i.e. $\pm 5$ MeV around $\epsilon_F$). This quantity is much smaller than the Fermi energy ($\sim 36$ MeV) and is essentially determined by the energy of the low-lying collective modes and of the single-particle gap around closed shell system, e.g. $^{208}$Pb.

\subsubsection{Caption Fig \ref{fig8.F.1}}
Schematic representation of the main quantities characterizing the single-particle motion in the nuclear shell model taking into account the residual interaction among the particles at different levels of approximation.
In (\textbf{a}) the bare $NN$-interaction is treated in the Hartree-Fock approximation and the particles feel the presence of the other particles through their own confinement in the average field. The strength function shows sharp peaks, each of them carrying the full strength of the states. In fact, the occupation number associated with each state $k$ contains only one contribution. In (\textbf{b}) the particles still couple   only  with the average field. However, in this case, they can set the surface into vibrations as well as excite a pair addition or removal mode, by changing its state of motion (particle-vibration coupling mechanism). The strength associated with each orbital is distributed over a finite energy range. The corresponding occupation numbers arise from the sum of many contributions. Fitting a Breit-Wigner  shape to each peak one can regain the simplicity of the extreme shell model by defining new levels with energy equal to that of the centroid and strength equal to that of the area covered by the Lorentzian shape (cf. (\textbf{c})). In (\textbf{d}) the energy variation of the shift of the centroids is contained into an effective $\omega$-mass according to the relation $\frac{m_\omega}{m}=\left(1-\frac{\partial \Delta E}{\partial \hbar \omega}\right)$ (see Eq. (\ref{eq6A5})). The resulting curve resembles the shape obtained by calculating the inverse of the area below the different Lorentzians (quasiparticle approximation).
