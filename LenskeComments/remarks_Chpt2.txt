Chpt.2:

1. p.67: the last paragraph, "An essential test..." is hardly understandable, 
   esp. the second sentence seems to be a fragment, the same for ""Coupligns which are.."
2. As a general reamrk: in many cases the figure captions are quite extensive, containing 
   important material whcih would better be discussed in the running text.
3. Fig.(2.4.1): much to busy!! No one will understand the meaning of all the lines, coming without labelling.
   Is that fig. really needed?
4. Fig.(2.4.2): the lines are a bit faint.
5. Sect. 2.7.4: Mayn of the figure are of bad quality - maybe it's a probelms of the proof printing?
6. Sect.2.9.2 is in danger to "trivialize" the optical potential problem. I'd suggest to refer to te vast literature on that subject, 
   ew.g. the books of Satchler, Feshbach, Hogdson and the reviews of Mahaux et al.   
7. p. 134: You should reconsider that busy figure: It is worth at least 5 separate figures and the the eqautions must be 
   discussed in the runnign text. That figure migth work in a talk where you lead by discussion the audience through the
   displayed material. But it's horrible in printed form, probably mainly due to the reduction from screen to page format.  
8. p.135/136: the numbering looks a bit odd - spend a period to the numbers, i.e. use 1. 2. 3.  
9. Fig(2.9.2) -> see remarks 2. and 7.
10. Fig,(2.9.3), upper part -> see remarks 2 . and 7.  
11. Fig.(2.9.4) -> see remark 2.
12. Fig.(2.9.5) -> see remark 2.
13. Fig.(2.10.1) another very busy figure which would deserve disassembling into a couple of separate figures. 
    I uderstand the intention to illustrated the interpay of various observables but is that also obvious to a 
    broader readership?
14. Conclusions on Chpt.2: Overall, it's well done, also the material in the appendices! The connection of microscopic aspects of nuclear many-body dynamics and nuclear phenomenology is elucidated
    by NFT. Why don't you start the chapter with intriducing NFT in the first place? I'd consider such a rearrangemnt an 
    interesting alternative, putting more weight on "hard" many-body theory.
