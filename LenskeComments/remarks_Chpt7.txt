Chpt. 7:
i like very much the applications to the halo systems. That aspect is worth to be put into the foreground in the introductory 
paragraph instead of the "software" issue (sse below). On the other hand, a brief introduction of the standard codes for numerical simulations of
nuclear structure and reaCtion problems and where to find them would be of great help for the reader.

- To me, the title looks like a fragment. Wouldn't it be better to choose a title "Structure Studies with Transfer Reactions" or 
"Transfer Reactions as Nuclear Structure Probes" or "Probing Nuclear Structure by Transfer Reactions"?
- The message of the very first sentence is unclear: What do you "with the help of software"? To me, one way of understanding is that you're 
  going to introduce computer codes (and make them available to the reader). However, a look into sect. 7.C shows that you are "only" giving a 
  conceptual description of a numerical scheme. Also, what means "see App. 7.C cooper, one"?
- Anyway, I'd use "computer codes", rather than the unspecific word "software".
- p.491, first line in sect. 7.1, misaligned 
- Fig. 7.1.2 is washed put, needs "sharpening"
- Fig. 7.1.3 exceeds the page layout. If reduced the text (configurations) in the two lower boxes might be hardyl readable
- Tabs. 7.1.1 and 7.4.2 are misaligned
- The titles of sects. 7.1.1 and 7.1.2 are looking a bit lost: "Structure" of what? "REaction" for what?
- p. 496, 2nd line, misaligned
- p. 496: "little convergent" means probably "weakly convergent"?
- Fig. 7.3.1: too busy, too small characters of the boxed-in text
- p. 512: the tile of sect. 7.5.1 deserves some explanation in the text. As it stands, reader will not understand the various mysterious 
  notations and how they are connected. Also mysteriously, that notation reappears as title in sect 7.6.
- first sentence of sect. 7.5.1: "phase space" might be misleadng, "configuration space" seems to be more appropriate. Many eaders 
  porbably connect "phase space" with the kinematical on-shell phase space of a reaction. The P- and Q-space concept and the related dressing 
  by induced interactions could be a better approach.
- p. 513: as I wrote before, "clothing" -> "dressing" might be the better choice, connecting more easily to the literature
- Eq.(7.6.1): indicate the coordinates also on the RHS of the equation
- App. 7.G: I like those "cross-disciplinary" discussions but I'm afraid that the un-introduced reader will be in dispair "What to the hell that has to 
  d0 with the rest of the book". A better motivation would help, indicating the generality of the phenomena.
